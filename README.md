PART I MOTIVATIONS
  In late November, when Xiaoyan was an exchange student at Duke University, she witnessed the highway was unexpectedly lined with protesters at RDU Airport. This first-hand witnessing of the tense and intense real-life operation related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement corroborates the polarized debate we had previously seen online.
  
  When we discovered through Wayback Machine that public attention towards the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reached an unprecedented historical peak in December 2024, we realized the severity of the issue. This data indicates that ICE is not only a long-standing problem but is also in the acute stage of a social crisis and is receiving intense scrutiny.
  
  We aim to systematically analyze the primary digital arena where this national conflict is negotiated: the content and comment sections of popular ICE-related videos on YouTube during its peak period of public scrutiny. Our research is guided by a core question that bridges media influence and public discourse:
  
“What systematic associations exist between the political leanings of media outlets, their framing of the ICE issue, and the structure of public discourse and sentiment within their YouTube comment sections?”

  To answer this, we will computationally map and compare the dominant narratives, emotional patterns, and ideological camps that emerge in these high-visibility spaces across media sources. Ultimately, this is an attempt to understand how YouTube works as a stage for one of America's most heated debates—shaped by the news people watch and the comments they write.
