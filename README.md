## Project Motivations

  During last Thanksgiving, one project member witnessed protesters hoding "ICE out of RDU" signs alongside the highway from Raleigh to Durham. This first-hand witnessing of protest against activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) aligns with the escalating public debate over immigrantion issues,civil rights and the exercise of statepower.   
  Data from the Wayback Machine indicates that public attention towards ICE reached an unprecedented historical peak in December 2024.This tension was undoubtly ignited by the recent shooting in Minnesota on Jan.7th, exacerbating the inherent conflicts between local and federal agencies, citizens and the state apparatus, as well as divergences between political ideologies.
