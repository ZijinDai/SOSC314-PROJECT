**PART I Motivations**

  During last Thanksgiving, one project member witnessed protesters hoding "ICE out of RDU" signs alongside the highway from Raleigh to Durham. This first-hand witnessing of protest against activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) aligns with the escalating public debate over immigrantion issues,civil rights and the exercise of statepower. Data from the Wayback Machine indicates that public attention towards ICE reached an unprecedented historical peak in December 2024.This tension was undoubtly ignited by the recent shooting in Minnesota on Jan.7th, exacerbating the inherent conflicts between local and federal agencies, citizens and the state apparatus, as well as divergences between political ideologies.
  
**PART II Research Question**

To what extent did the Minnesota shooting trigger a shift in public opinions regarding ICE on YouTube, and how do the temporal evolutions of ICE related online discussions reflect public perceptions of state repressive power and political polarization?

RQ1 (Impact): Does the Minnesota shooting represent a significant causal breakpoint in the volume, sentiment, and thematic focus of ICE-related discourse over time?  
RQ2 (Legitimacy): Does public perception on ICE's legitimacy as a federal institution changed overtime?  
RQ3 (Polarization): To what degree are ideological and sentimental divergents showcased in online ICE related discusions? Are these divergents align with media discourses?
