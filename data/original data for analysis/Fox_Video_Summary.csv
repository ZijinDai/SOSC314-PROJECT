right, let's get out to Senate Majority
Leader John Thun who is joining us from
the great state of Texas down at the
southern border right now where the
border is now secure. A huge
accomplishment for the Trump
administration really day one. A
majority leader, thank you for joining
us on our debut show.
&gt;&gt; Great to be with you. Thanks Aisha. I
want to get to those border numbers in
just a second, but first let's talk
about the immigration battle that is
escalating across the country and how
it's going to bleed into what's
happening uh on Capitol Hill. We've got
Democrats now that are so angry over
this ICE shooting in Minneapolis that
they want to block funding. In fact, the
senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy,
tweeted this. Democrats cannot vote for
a Homeland Security budget that doesn't
restrain the growing lawlessness of this
agency. So, Majority Leader, how are you
going to respond to these growing
threats from these Democrats?
&gt;&gt; Well, it's kind of expected, Aisha. The
Democrats are uh right now uh pretty
much unhappy about anything and Trump
derangement syndrome is the big cause of
that. So, there isn't anything that this
president can do even on matters as
basic as enforcing the law. Obviously,
the ICE agents are enforcing uh
immigration laws in this country and um
you know, they're running into
resistance from some of these uh uh blue
states, cities, and and um you know,
states around the country that are
resistive to enforcing enforcement of
those laws. But at the end of the day,
it's their job, and it's what we asked
them to do. uh it's part of the
enforcement that this president ran on
and was elected on and that is to make
sure that people who are in this country
are here in this country legally. And so
um that's that's just the way it is. And
uh you know we've got to back our law
enforcement officers. Uh the Democrats
may resist doing that that they've been
very clear about that for some time now.
Um they don't want to see the laws in
this country enforced. That's why they
had a open border for the past uh four
years down here under Biden. But uh this
is an administration uh with a backing
of the Congress that is going to stand
behind our law enforcement officers.
&gt;&gt; One more quick question on Minnesota.
The vice president earlier in the week
uh mentioned your names that he talked
to you about nominating and hopefully
swiftly confirming a new assistant
attorney general that would look into
fraud not only in Minnesota but across
the country. Have you been talking to
the White House about names and
potentially when that might happen? Uh
we have had conversations with the with
the white house Aisha. That's right. And
uh I think in and absolutely we should
be investigating fraud in this country.
If you have states uh in this case the
state of Minnesota but there other
states particularly blue states around
the country who have been looking for
ways to abuse and game the system uh not
follow the law when it comes to uh
benefits that are going to people in
this country in some cases illegal
people in some cases people who are not
qualified to receive those benefits.
That's fraud and that's a ripoff of the
American taxpayer and that needs to be
investigated. And so if the White House
wants to pursue that, yeah, we are more
than happy to work with them to ensure
that the laws in this country are being
followed and the people who are supposed
to get benefits and get assistance from
the federal government are getting it,
but those that who are not uh are not
gaming the system and committing fraud.
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's talk about the border. It
was a winning issue for Republicans in
2024. And if you pull up the numbers, I
mean, they're fascinating to look at. We
had over 10,000 on any given day
encounters at the border, apprehensions
at the border every single day uh during
the Biden administration. Today, it's
somewhere close to maybe just about 200
people coming across the border. So, the
numbers are incredible. But take a look
at what's developed now. Recent Fox News
polling shows Americans seem to have
moved on from the border story. Across
the board, immigration is at the bottom
of what they want. President Trump to be
paying attention to. In fact, just about
3% of Democrats, 12% of Republicans, and
6% of independents want him to
prioritize immigration. So, majority
leader, how do you make the border,
which is a success, and immigration,
which is what everyone is now debating
about, how do you make those a winning
issue for Republicans in 2026?
Well, Aisha, I think every every
president uh would love to have their
policies be so effective that the
problem no longer exists. And
[clears throat] that's certainly uh you
could argue at least with President
Trump and his policies, there hasn't
been a single person and since he took
office, and it's almost a year now that
he's been in office, um who's been
released illegally into the country. Uh
this border is for all intents and
purposes secure. I was down here in
2021. I was here in 2023 uh both times
under the Biden administration and their
open borders policy and it was just it
was chaos. It was anarchy and you saw
that in the country. Drugs coming into
the country, weapons coming into the
country, human trafficking, all this
cartel activity, it's been shut down and
and that's a that's a huge win for the
American people and the president needs
to take credit for that. Um but we need
to continue to do diligence to ensure
that it doesn't become a problem again.
And I think that's where uh enforcing
the laws in this country, we are first
and foremost a nation of laws. Uh people
have to understand that this president
was elected on that. And uh so we're
going to continue to enforce the laws,
but pivot at the same time to these
other issues. And I think frankly um the
president has a great record to run out
of accomplishment when it comes to the
economy. Inflation is coming down, gas
prices are coming down, uh job growth
and job uh wage growth, I should say, is
up in this country. And I think as our
policies working with this
administration, with the president on
his economic policy agenda, continue to
be played out and implemented this next
year, you're only going to see that
improve and continue to improve for the
American people. They're going to have
more money in their pockets. They're
going to have safer streets because of
the the border policies, and they're
going to have new opportunities to get
ahead because of many of the things that
were included in the one big beautiful
bill.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Finally, uh you are backing
Senator John Cornin for uh the Texas
Senate seat for reelection. He's facing
a pretty crowded primary here. Um, do
you think that if Ken Paxton wins this
nomination that he would not be able to
win the general?
&gt;&gt; Well, I just I'm I'm here to support
Senator Cornin. He is an incredibly
effective senator for the state of
Texas. We also know, the polling shows
this, that if he is the nominee, that
the Texas Senate race is a much easier
path uh for us to continue to to hold
that seat and and and and spend a lot
less money in the state of Texas. And
so, obviously, we're interested in the
whole map. Uh we're looking at races
around the country. We want to deploy
resources and a um you know, wisely and
well and make sure that we're getting um
you know, the money into the places
where we can potentially pick up some
seats. and we would rather not spend a
lot of money in the state of Texas. And
I think John Cornin is our nominee
coming out of this primary uh enables us
to ensure that Texas remains Republican
uh in a way that doesn't cost a lot of
money and enables us to deploy resources
elsewhere where we have chances to pick
up seats.
&gt;&gt; Would a Donald J. Trump endorsement of
John Cornin in the next 60 days decide
this primary?
&gt;&gt; Totally. Absolutely. 100%. And um that
that would be wonderful if that happens.
So, have you have you asked? We're just
Senator Cornin is running hard. Um we're
doing everything we can to support him.
&gt;&gt; Uh yes, I have. Um yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Are we going to get one?
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know about that. The
president makes his decisions on his own
time. Um we've had a number of
conversations about Texas Senate and uh
hopefully um you know in due time that
would be a great outcome and I think it
would obviously enable us to be uh
competitive a lot of places around the
country and and use resources wisely and
well. All right. Uh, we'll watch to see
what the president decides to do.
There's still a little bit of time for
him to think about this. Um, a majority
leader, thank you so much for joining
us. I know you're very busy, so we
appreciate the time. Good to see you.

Hman. Tom, thank you for being here.
Appreciate it. Immediately after the
shooting, you said that it would be
unprofessional to comment on what I
think happened in that situation. Let
the investigation play out and hold
people accountable based on that
investigation. Since that time, we've
seen a lot more evidence come out,
including cell phone video from the
officer who shot Renee Good. What is
your assessment now? Look, you know what
I've when I did that interview, I went
straight from an airplane tarmac to that
interview. So when someone shows me one
video, cherrypicked video and ask me to
comment, I just think it was
inappropriate for me to do so. But look,
I since then, I've looked at a bunch of
videos. Uh, and I believe I truly
believe that that officer thought his
life was in danger to take that action.
Now, look, we won't let the
investigation play out. You know,
there's a lot of things we all don't
know. There's probably a lot of video we
haven't seen, but the FBI has even ring
video there. What's the statement from
the officer? What's the statement from
the witnesses? What's ballistics? The
ballistics, you know, I'm sure they're
looking at ballistics in the forensics.
There's a lot of information needs to
come out. So, I I'm still going to say,
let's stop the hypo ready. You can't
compare this to murder. Murder requires
malice. That is just dangerous to put
that type of language out. Let the
investigation play out and see what and
see where see where it lies.
The DHS secretary, Christine Gnome,
concluded pretty quickly that this was a
domestic terrorism incident. She said
that while the scene was still being
processed and said the dead woman was
part of a left-wing disruption scheme,
you know, with those statements, why
should federal authorities be the ones
investigating it? It almost sounds like
there's nothing left to investigate.
&gt;&gt; Look, it's a federal crime to impede an
interfer with an ICE officer. And I
think look, it's a coordinated attack.
We can see what's happening throughout
the country. I think it's a funded
organized attack against ICE officers.
And what really irritates me is we we
the left wants to play this game that
ICE as you know they're not law
enforcement officers. They are federal
law enforcement officers. Impeding them
and interfering them is a is a crime. No
one would be arguing if you know if we
arresting people that interfere with DEA
before you know arresting a drug dealer
or US Marshall in attempts to arrest a
fugitive. If someone stood in your way,
that's a crime you would be arrested.
But it seems like they want to, you
know, they normalize, the media is
normalizing interference with ICE. It is
a crime to impede ICE officers. Bill
Malusian just put out a list of 18 of
the most worst of the worst in
Minneapolis. Many of them child sex
crimes, child rape, child sodomy. These
are the people we're looking for. For
anybody that's interfering, that is
unconscionable. We need to enforce law
and arrest these bad guys. We've already
arrested over a thousand people in that
state. and we're going to continue to do
exactly what Congress has allowed us to
do and what the law allows us to do.
&gt;&gt; Back to the investigation, you know, the
state authorities reject the
administration's claim that they don't
have any jurisdiction to investigate.
Um, and some Republican senators,
including Tom Tillis, Lisa Marowski,
took issue with them being excluded from
this probe, uh, saying that could create
unnecessary suspicion. And the Henipin
County Sheriff's Office said, ""We've
spoken with sheriffs throughout our
county. We all agree that an
investigative process that excludes
local agencies has the potential to have
harmful implications nationwide. Why
should people trust that this
investigation will be fair?
&gt;&gt; It's a federal crime that needs to be
investigated by the FBI. That's the way
this whole system set up. I trust the
FBI to do the right thing.
&gt;&gt; We've also heard this justification that
um local authorities don't collaborate
with uh federal officials on law
enforcement. So, why should they be
involved now that it's time to
investigate a federal officer? Um, but
is this lack of collaboration a one-time
decision that's specific to this case,
or are we watching a new broader policy
roll out here?
&gt;&gt; No, look, that state's a sanctuary
state. It's a sanctuary city. They don't
work with us. And that's one of the
problems here and it's one of the reason
we're in the position we're in in that
city because law enforcement response
has been sporadic at best. This is
sanctuary city. Let's remember why we
why are we in that city right now?
Because you're a sanctuary city that
purposely releases public safety threats
back into the public. I just mentioned
about all these cases that child sex
crime, child sodomy, child rape that
they released back into the community.
These are people we have to go look for.
And who set the stage for all this? The
last four years on the open border,
millions of people released in this
country without vetting. A lot of
criminals, a lot of national security
threats. That's that's why we're there.
Let's not forget who set the stage on
this. So all these people on the
Democratic side and all these liberal
people want to scream and yell about our
law enforcement activities. They didn't
say a word when there's an open border.
They didn't say a word when half million
children were smuggling this country.
Lost track of 300,000 and they weren't
even looking for them. President Trump
in this administration found 129,000 of
them. They were silent then. They were
complicit on on on millions of people
being released in this country, many of
them criminals. didn't say a word. Now
all of a sudden, because we're trying to
fix four years of an open border, now
they're all of a sudden they got an
opinion.
&gt;&gt; There are already 2,000 or so federal
agents um in Minneapolis for this
massive crackdown that's tied in part to
this ongoing probe of alleged Somali
fraud. Um Fox is told that about a
thousand more Border Patrol agents are
going to be heading there to assist,
basically free up HSI officers. Um,
there's also this growing network of
local residents who are tracking ice
movements and warning people about them
and schools in the area are being given
the option of remote learning for the
next month because of how hot the
environment is getting. Yeah. Are you
concerned about what we're heading
toward? And what do you say to those
officials like Mayor Frey who's accused
the administration of just looking for
an excuse to invoke the insurrection
act?
&gt;&gt; It's ridiculous. Bottom line is they
don't have to shut the schools down.
They can't give me one example where
ISIS walked into an elementary school or
a church or hospital. It's ridiculous.
And all this false narrative that
they're pushing is just going to double
down on hate against ICE. For instance,
calling in a murder that the mayor
calling it murder. The hateful rhetoric
has caused a lot of this violence. I
said way back in March, if the hateful
rhetoric doesn't decrease, there will be
bloodshed. Unfortunately, I was right.
And it's not over. There will be more
bloodshed unless we decrease the hateful
reddic to compare this officer to a
murder. Are you kidding me? Threats
against ICE officer uh actual attacks
are up 1300%. A lot of this based on the
hateful reic from people who don't
understand what's going on and don't
want to face the facts. If if you want a
safe city, if you want ICE out of your
city, then stop being a sanctuary city.
Give Icy access to your jail to arrest a
bad guy in the safety and security of a
jail which is safer for the officer,
safer for the alien, and safer the
community. You force us in the community
to find these people.
So sanctuary cities are sanctuaries for
criminals. More agents in your jail
means less agents in your community. But
don't don't mistake anything. We're
going to get this job done. If he forces
in the community to rest the bad guys,
that's exactly what we're going to do.
And when we do that, we may find others
who weren't a public safety threat,
weren't the target of the arrest, but
they're coming, too, because we'll
enforce immigration law. Work with us.
I'm begging you, stop the hate for
rhetoric. I don't want to see anybody
die. There's been too much death. Work
with us. Help us make your city safer.

agents battering down people's doors
without a warrant, racially profiling
people on the street.
&gt;&gt; This is not about safety. This is not
about immigration. This is about sewing
chaos on the streets of Minneapolis.
This is about political retribution.
&gt;&gt; This looks like modern-day slave
patrols.
Top Democrats holding a field hearing in
Minnesota to investigate ICE, slamming
the agency as protesters clash with
agents in Minneapolis. Here to react is
former Speaker of the House and Fox News
political analyst N. Genrich. Nude, it's
always great to have you on. Good
morning. Um, so obviously
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Obviously the Democrats think
this is a winning political issue going
into the midterms. I also remember knew
when they thought that BLM and you know
defund the police was what are your
thoughts? Is this going to be useful to
them politically speaking?
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, if you want to run as
the party that's pro illegal immigration
that is against deporting illegal
immigrants who are criminals uh that
wants to basically break the law against
federal officials. Remember, ICE is in
fact a federal agency and under federal
law, they have the right, they have the
duty to enforce the law and most
Americans agree uh that if you find
people who are here illegally uh that
you have the right to deport them. I
don't think there's any doubt about that
for most Americans. But the Democrats
have adopted across the board a pro-
illegal immigration uh you know pro-
allowing uh criminals rather than the
police and a willingness to encourage
people to break the law. I I don't think
that's sustainable.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not sustainable. But again, I
get to the question of why. How much do
you think perhaps this has to do with
the census? The census counts everybody
whether they're illegal or not. And then
the uh the congressmen um are aortioned
according to population, not not
citizens. Do you think this could be
part of a way for them to hold on to
power? If if a lot of illegals get
deported and and and illegals continue
to not come to this country, uh they
lose power, don't they?
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's deeper than that. I
think you're right. But in addition to
that, I think there's something at in
the core values of the left that is
always in favor of the criminal that was
true for domestic criminals, not just
for illegal immigrants. It's always
against the police. It's always against
authority. Uh and they just can't help
themselves. They have a visceral
immediate response that if you represent
authority, you must be bad. And if
you're a criminal, it was probably
something in your childhood. you know,
it's not your fault that you're a rapist
or a murderer and we shouldn't be too
difficult in dealing with you. I mean, I
personally think it's nuts, but for a
very substantial maybe 20% of the
country, uh, they really do believe
these kind of strange values.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I couldn't agree more. Well, the
White House National Economic Council
Director Kevin Hasset says that Trump is
going to announce a major housing plan
at Davos and he's revealing that he will
let Americans tap their 401ks for down
payments. Watch this.
&gt;&gt; The truth is that fewer people are
buying homes right now than we've seen
pretty much in my lifetime. And the
reason is that we had runaway Biden
inflation and the down payment they
needed to buy a home went from about
$15,000 uh to about $32,000. And so
there's a real lot of room to make up
and we've got a whole bunch of policies
that are going to help people do that.
We're going to allow people uh to take
money out of their 401ks and use that
for down payment.
&gt;&gt; So new last week they said the president
said that he was going to stop private
equity firms from purchasing homes. So
homes are for people, not private equity
firms. And now this um and he's
announcing it at Davos where they said
you can you you won't own anything and
you'll be happy. So tell me about that.
&gt;&gt; Well well f first of all K as you know
is the ambassador to Switzerland. So
we're looking forward to seeing the
president next week at the World
Economic Forum. Um I I think he's making
a very calculated uh distinction.
Investing in a home, building up home
ownership is in fact a major step for
most Americans in preparing for
retirement. So why shouldn't you be able
to get the same tax break that you would
get in a 401k which helps you with your
retirement? And I think there's a real
desire here to reestablish home
ownership as a base for the American
system. And it was frankly compounded by
the way we allowed the politicians
allowed uh student loans to get out of
control. So all too many young people
graduated from college or from medical
school or law school owing so much money
that they couldn't afford to buy a home.
Well, we want to reverse that. We want
to make it easy to save up and to become
a homeowner because people behave
differently if they have an investment
in their neighborhood, if they have a
sense of property, if they're involved
in taking care of something, which in 20
or 30 years becomes a very valuable nest
egg. I mean, the number of senior
Americans whose biggest single asset is
their home is remarkable. And that was a
long-term project that moved us from
being a nation of renters to a nation of
property owners. And I think Prince I
think that President Trump is trying to
do the same thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So once one side is uh defending
criminals um and against the other
side's trying to bring you a home. We'll
see how these midterms go, right? Uh new
King,
&gt;&gt; we appreciate you joining us so early in
the morning. Thank you. And say hello to
Kalista from us.

COMPANIES WOULD PUT UP WITH
THAT FOR TOO LONG.
WE’LL SEE.
ALEXIS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
LET’S BRING IN ACTING I.C.E.
DIRECTOR TODD LIONS.
SIR, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT,
YOU SEE THAT CASE -- I
BELIEVE IT WAS A LOCKED CASE
WITH GUNSS IN.
ALEXIS SAID THEY’RE NOT SURE
IF THAT WAS A FEDERAL
VEHICLE OR NOT.
DO YOU KNOW?
WAS THAT A FEDERAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT VEHICLE THAT WAS
BROKEN INTO?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, MARTHA.
WITHOUT GETTING TOO MUCH
INTO THE INVESTIGATION, IT
WAS A FEDERAL VEHICLE.
BUT JUST TO THE POINT, THAT
IS NOT PEACEFUL PROTESTING.
THAT’S NOT WHAT THE GOVERNOR,
NOT WHAT THE MAYOR IS
CALLING FOR.
THAT’S ANARCHY PLAIN AND
SIMPLE.
THAT’S IMPEDIMENT.
AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT’S
WHAT I.C.E. AGENTS ARE
ENCOUNTERING EVERY DAY.
WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS
ELECTED OFFICIALS TO SAY,
YOU KNOW, YOU ACCOUNT
PEACEFULLY PROTEST BUT NOT
LIKE THAT.
NOT THROWING FIREWORKS, NOT
BREAKING INTO VEHICLES, NOT
PUTTING YOUR HANDS ON I.C.E.
AGENTS.
BUT INSTEAD THEY JUST KEEP
INCREASING THE RHETORIC AND
THAT’S WHY YOU KEEP SEEING
THIS NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WHAT
THE MEN AND WOMEN OF I.C.E.
AND OUR OTHER FEDERAL
PARTNERS AND TO EFFECT OTHER
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE
ENCOUNTERING DAILY.
&gt;&gt; Martha: DO YOU WANT THE
INSURRECTION ACT EMPLOYED
HERE?
DO YOUR FOLKS NEED IT?
IS THAT WHAT YOU’RE ASKING
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO DO?
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, MARTHA, WE’RE
NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF
THE PRESIDENT BUT I WILL
TELL YOU SECRETARY NOEM’S
GIVEN US ALL HER TOOLS AT
HER DISPOSAL TO GO AHEAD AND
PROTECT OUR AGENTS.
JUST SEEING THIS, WE HAVE
THE MAYOR SAY THERE’S SO
MANY I.C.E. AGENTS AND
BORDER PATROL AGENTS ON THE
GROUND.
THE PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT
YOU HAVE LOCAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT, WHO DON’T COME
TO THE AID OF FEDERAL
ENFORCEMENT WHEN WE ASK FOR
IT.
YOU HAVE PROTESTERS THAT ARE
SHOWING UP WITHIN SECONDS,
IF NOT MINUTES, TO AN I.C.E.
ARREST.
SO OF COURSE WE HAVE TO
START BRINGING OUR OWN
RESOURCES IN THERE.
AND IT’S CAUSING SITUATIONS
JUST LIKE THIS.
IF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
LOCAL OFFICIALS JUST WORK
WITH US ON THE FRONT END AND
TAKE THESE INDIVIDUALS IN
CUSTODY, YOU WOULDN’T SEE
THIS.
BUT NO.
INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR THE
PROTESTS TO STOP, STOP
IMPEDING I.C.E. AGENTS, WHAT
THEY DO CONFIDENT PEOPLE
THAT ACTIVELY RESIST AND
THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT YOU’RE
SEEING HERE.
&gt;&gt; Martha: IS IT WORKING?
I MEAN WHAT WERE THE TARGETS
FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU WENT
INTO THE STATE OF MINNESOTA
WITH WANTING TO APPREHEND
BASED ON THEIR CRIMINAL
RECORDS?
ARE YOU GETTING THOSE
NUMBERS?
YOU’LL BE ABLE TO DO IT IN
THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS?
&gt;&gt; WE ARE.
[ Siren ]
AND A TRUE ACCOMPLISHMENT TO
THE MEN AND WOMEN OF I.C.E.
IS THE FACT WE ARE BRAKING A
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AND A
LARM NUMBER OF ARRESTS
THROUGH ALL THESE KIND OF
PROTESTS.
BECAUSE WE HAD TO BRING IN
SO MANY FEDERAL RESOURCES
JUST TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR
OUR OWN FOLKS.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORST
OF THE WORST, WHAT D.H.S.
PUT OUT.
WE’VE HAD SO MANY RAPISTS,
MURDERERS ROAMING FREE
HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT IN
MINNEAPOLIS NMINNESOTA.
WE WOULD HOPE THAT ELECTED
OFFICIALS AND THE PUBLIC
WOULD BE THANKING I.C.E. FOR
TAKING THEM OUT OF THE
COMMUNITY.
INSTEAD WE HAVE INCIDENTS
LOOK YOU’RE SEEING ON SCREEN
RIGHT THERE.
&gt;&gt; Martha: THIS FIRST VIDEO
IS I.C.E. AGENTS PULLING A
WOMAN OUT OF A CAR IN
MINNEAPOLIS.
I READ A PIECE THIS MORNING
ABOUT HER, THAT SHE IS AN
ACTIVIST.
BUT CLEARLY THIS KIND OF
VIDEO IS THE SORT OF THING
THAT, YOU KNOW, GETS PEOPLE
RILED UP.
THEY MAY NOT KNOW ALL THE
DETAILS AROUND IT.
WHAT DO YOU SI ABOUT THIS
VIDEO?
&gt;&gt; MARTHA, YOU JUST SAID IT
PERFECTLY RIGHT THERE.
THERE’S SO MUCH OF THAT
VIDEO NO ONE ELSE HAS SEEN
UNFORTUNATELY, RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; Martha: YOU CAN’T TELL US
WHAT ELSE HAPPENED HERE THAT
PROVOKED THIS EXCHANGE?
&gt;&gt; WITHOUT GETTING TOO
SPECIFIC, WE DO HAVE
CRIMINAL CHARGES ON THAT
INDIVIDUAL.
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT’S
DRIVING INTO A SCENE,
DRIVING INTO A LAW
ENFORCEMENT SITUATION AFTER
BEING WARNED NOT TO DO THAT,
YOU KNOW.
COMING AT OFFICERS, BLOCKING
IN VEHICLES.
THEN WHEN SHE’S TOLD TO GET
OUT OF THE CAR SHE DOESN’T
AND SHE RESISTS AT THAT
POINT.
AND UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN, YOU
KNOW, I HATE TO SOUND LIKE A
BROKEN RECORD BUT WHEN YOU
HAVE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT
ARE SAYING GO OUT AND DO
THIS.
GO OUT AND IMPEDE I.C.E.,
YOU KNOW.
GO OUT AND PROTECT YOUR
NEIGHBOR.
AND THEY’RE DOING IT LIKE
THIS, THIS IS -- THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENS THAT LEADS TO
IT.
AND UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW,
THESE VIDEOS COME UP AND
THERE’S ONLY ONE SIDE TO IT
AND WE’RE CONSTANTLY HAVING
TO GO ON THE DEFENSE.
BUT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF
I.C.E. ARE PROFESSIONAL.
PROFESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS.
THAT’S WHAT THEY’RE OUT
THERE DOING EVERY DAY.
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE
HAVE TO MAKE SURE OUR MEN
AND WOMEN OF I.C.E. AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT ARE SAFE EVERY
NIGHT.
&gt;&gt; Martha: THIS IS ANOTHER
VIDEO.
SOME I.C.E. AGENTS WALKING
IN THE FRONT DOOR OF A
MEXICAN RESTAURANT IS WHAT
IS REPORTED HERE IN St.
PAUL.
THEY GET SCREAMED AT AND
THEN THEY GO OUT THE BACK
DOOR.
WHEN I WATCH THIS I’M TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT’S GOING
ON.
THEY HAVE MASKS THERE.
ARE THEY THERE TO APPREHEND
SOMEONE?
ARE THEY THERE BECAUSE
THERE’S A TARGET IN THAT
RESTAURANT?
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS?
&gt;&gt; SO IN THOSE SITUATIONS,
MARTHA, ARE TWOFOLD, RIGHT.
SO WE DO HAVE HOMELAND
SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS
SPECIAL AGENTS THAT ARE ON
THE GROUND AND THEY’RE ALSO
INVESTIGATING POTENTIAL WORK
SITE ENFORCEMENT SITUATIONS
WHERE WE’VE RECEIVED TIPS OR
WE HAVE KNOWN TARGETS THAT
ARE BEING EMPLOYED IN THE
UNITED STATES OR IN A
RESTAURANT, SAY IN THIS
SITUATION.
AND THEY GO IN TO
INVESTIGATE THAT.
WE DO A LOT OF CONSENSUAL
ENCOUNTERS WHEN WE DO WORK
SITE ENFORCEMENT.
WE WORK WITH EMPLOYERS TO
SEE WHO’S ACTUALLY THERE
THERE.
IF WE HAVE A TIP SOMEONE
MAYBE INVOLVED IN HUMAN
SMUGGLING OR SOME TYPE OF
FORCED LABOR SITUATION.
THAT’S WHAT THEY DO.
SO IN ALL SITUATIONS THEY’LL
GO THERE AND CONDUCT A
CONSENSUAL INTERVIEW,
INVESTIGATION WITH THAT
BUSINESS OWNER.
IF THEY DEVELOP ANY LEADS OR"

&gt;&gt; John: JONATHAN HUNT FOR US
WITH THE UPDATE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
&gt;&gt; Sandra: LET’S BRING IN THE
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY
KAROLINE LEAVITT LA FROM THE
TOURNAMENT HAS.
WELCOME TO YOU.
WELCOME BACK.
&gt;&gt; GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.
&gt;&gt; Sandra: CAN WE PROTECT THESE
ICE OFFICERS LAWFULLY CARRYING
OUT THEIR DUTIES?
&gt;&gt; THE ADMINISTRATION FULLY
INTENDS TO.
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE ENTIRE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION STANCE
FAMILY WITH THE BRAVE MEN AND
WOMEN OF ICE WHO ARE EVERYDAY
AMERICANS WHO PUT ON THEIR
UNIFORM EVERY DAY TO PROTECT OUR
COMMUNITIES AND TO CARRY OUT
LAWFUL, LAW ENFORCEMENT
OPERATIONS.
THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING
ON THE GROUND IN MINNESOTA AND
THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN TAKING
PLACE IN EVERY COMMUNITY ACROSS
THE COUNTRY AND I WANT TO ZOOM
OUT AND SEE THESE AGITATORS WHO
HAVE BEEN VIOLENTLY PROTESTING
AND HARASSING ICE AGENTS ALL
WEEKEND LONG.
WHAT ARE THEY OUT THERE
PROTESTING FOR?
I’M ACTIVELY TRYING TO IMPEDE
LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS AND
END THE PRESIDENT TRUMP’S
MANDATE TO DEPORT ILLEGAL ALIEN
CRIMINALS FROM OUR COMMUNITIES
AND IT IS FOX NEWS’ VERY OWN
BILL MELUGIN WHO DID EXCEPTIONAL
REPORTING.
THESE ARE ILLEGAL ALIEN CRIMINAL
DATAFILES, MURDERERS, PAPISTS,
SOME OF THE WORST OF THE WORST
CRIMINALS WHO IF GIVEN THE
CHANCE WOULD COMMIT THOSE SAME
HEINOUS CRIMES TO THE PROTESTERS
IN THE STREETS OF MINNEAPOLIS
RIGHT NOW.
THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES, OF
COURSE, WE ARE SEARCHING
RESOURCES TO IN MINNEAPOLIS IN
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO
DELIVER ON PRESIDENT TRUMP’S
MANDATE THAT REMOVE VIOLENT
ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM OUR
COMMUNITIES AND MAKE AMERICA
SAFE AGAIN.
&gt;&gt; John: YOU GOT A LIST OF
APPREHENSIONS.
MICHAEL WHO IS GOING TO BE WITH
US NEXT HOUR PUT ON X, THE PDF
IS MINNESOTA THINKING ABOUT
PROTECTING PEOPLE LIKE THIS?
IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST
WEDNESDAY AND THE OFFICER WHO
WAS INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING, IS
THE PRESIDENT STANDING FULLY
BEHIND THE OFFICER, THE AGENT?
DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE HIS
ACTIONS WERE JUSTIFIED?
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK THE MORE EVIDENCE THAT
COMES OUT SHOWS THE OFFICER WAS
JUSTIFIED AND PLACED IN TRUCK
WAS RIGHT ABOUT THIS ALL ALONG
AND WHO WAS WRONG?
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA WHO DESPICABLY
HAVE BEEN LYING ABOUT THIS
OFFICER AND ABOUT THIS CASE FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING AND THEY HAVE
HAD TO CHANGE THEIR STORY AND
THEIR NARRATIVE BECAUSE AT
FIRST, YOU HEARD DEMOCRATS
INCLUDING THE MAYOR OF
MINNEAPOLIS SAYING THAT THE CAR
NEVER STRUCK THE OFFICER AND THE
ONLY FULL FORCE WAS UNJUSTIFIED.
NOW OF COURSE THERE IS PLENTIFUL
VIDEO EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE
OFFICER WAS STRUCK BY THE CAR,
AT THE STRANGE LUNATIC WOMAN WAS
TRYING TO RAM HIM OVER WITH HER
VEHICLE AND WAS WAS THAT VEHICLE
AS A WEAPON WHICH JUSTIFIES
DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND
UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE SEEING
THESE INSTANCES PLAY OUT IN
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY WHERE YOU HAVE THESE
ORGANIZED PAID ANTAGONIST WHO
ARE PART OF THESE GROUPS THAT
ARE ACTIVELY UNLAWFULLY THAT THE
-- IMPEDING LAWFUL LAW
ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS.
THEY ARE HARASSING AND TARGETING
ICE AGENTS, TRYING TO MAKE IT
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CARRY OUT
THEIR DUTIES.
THAT IS WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN
THIS CASE.
THE OFFICER USED HIS TRAINING.
I UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS BEEN ON
THE FORCE ON THE FIRST AND HE
HAS BEEN PROTECTING AMERICAN
COMMUNITIES FOR MANY, MANY
YEARS.
HE IS AN EXTREMIST AND BRAVE
RITUAL, AND REPORTEDLY HAD TO
MAKE A VERY TOUGH DECISION AND
WAS PUT IN THAT POSITION BY
THESE PAID AGITATORS WHO HAVE
BEEN DOING THIS ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY.
&gt;&gt; Sandra: TOMORROW WE EXPECT
THE PRESIDENT TO DELIVER A
MESSAGE ON THE ECONOMY.
PROGRAMMING ALERT, WE BELIEVE
THAT WILL BE HAPPENING, IS IT
TRUE?
EASTERN TIME OR 2:00 LOCAL,
DETROIT, IT IS DETROIT, EASTERN
TIME.
WE WILL CARRY THAT RIGHT HERE.
WHAT WILL HIS MESSAGE WE NOW
JUST MONTHS FROM THE MIDTERM
ELECTIONS.
WHAT WILL HE DIAL INTO AS HIS
WINNING MESSAGE ON THE ECONOMY?
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT TRUMP SINCE JANUARY
BEEN LASER FOCUS ON MAKING
AMERICA AFFORDABLE AGAIN.
AND HE IS DOING JUST THAT.
TOMORROW, HE LOOKS FORWARD TO
TRAVELING TO THE GREAT STATE OF
MICHIGAN, A STATE HE WON BIG IS
NOT ONLY TOUR FACTORY THAT
PRODUCES FORD F-150’S AND WILL
BE PRODUCING MORE TRACKS RIGHT
HERE IN THE USA BECAUSE OF
CREDITED TRUMP EFFECTIVE CARE
POLICIES BUT THE PRESIDENT IS
ALSO GOING TO DELIVER AN
ECONOMIC ADDRESS WHERE HE IS
GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE
POSITIVE ECONOMIC NEWS THAT WE
CONTINUE TO SEE AS A RESULT OF
HIS AGENDA.
WE HAVE MORTGAGE RATES THAT ARE
FALLING UNDER 6% FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN YEARS.
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF GASOLINE
IS THE LOWEST THAT IT HAS BEEN
IN FIVE YEARS.
WE HAVE CORE INFLATION AT ITS
LOWEST LEVEL IN FIVE YEARS AND
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PATIENCE
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE AMERICAN
PEOPLE I GOING TO CONTINUE TO
SEE THAT THE BEST IS YET TO
COME.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A PROVEN
ECONOMIC FORMULA THAT WORKS THAT
HE DELIVERED ON IT IN HIS FIRST
TERM.
AND IN 2026, PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN
AND IN EVERY STATE ACROSS THE
COUNTRY ARE GOING TO SEE MORE
MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS THANKS TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S WORKING
FAMILIES TAX CUT THAT HE SIGNED
INTO LAW LAST YEAR.
THOSE TAX REBATES WILL GO INTO
EFFECT THIS VIEW, THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICAN
CAN LOOK FORWARD TO UP TO $1,000
BACK INTO THEIR WALLETS BECAUSE
OF THOSE SIGNATURE TAX CUTS.
THE BEST IS YET TO COME.
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO
STOP WORKING.
HE HAS HOUSING PLANS.
YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM
THE PRESIDENT AND HE WILL SPEAK
DIRECTLY WITH THE PEOPLE HE
LOVES MOST, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
&gt;&gt; John: THAT IS TOMORROW
AFTERNOON.
WE WILL BE CARRYING THAT SPEECH
LIVE FROM DETROIT.
THEN LET’S LOOK AHEAD TO
THURSDAY, WHERE IT HAS BEEN IS
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO
BE MEETING WITH THE VENEZUELAN
OPPOSITION LEADER.
THE PRESIDENT SAID AFTER MADURO
WAS DEPOSED AND CAPTURED AND
BROUGHT TO THE UNITED STATES
THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT
MACHADO HAD THE SUPPORT WITHIN
VENEZUELA TO BECOME AT LEAST THE
INTERIM PRESIDENT.
THE LAST ELECTION GOT MORE THAN
80% OF THE VOTE.
WHY DID THE PRESIDENT THE BELIEF
SHE WOULD HAVE THE SUPPORT TO
BECOME INTERIM PRESIDENT?
&gt;&gt; I THINK PLANE TO AND HIS
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM MADE A
REALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF THE
REALITY ON THE GROUND IN
VENEZUELA AND THAT DECISION HAS
TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD ONE
BECAUSE LOOK AT WHAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS TEAM
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN
JUST A LITTLE OVER A WEEK.
SINCE THE CAPTURE OF THE
ILLEGITIMATE DICTATOR OF
VENEZUELA, A NICOLAS MADURO WHO
CONTINUES TO SIT IN A JAIL CELL
IN NEW YORK.
LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED.
WE HAD COMPLETE COOPERATION THUS
FAR FROM THE INTERIM AUTHORITIES
IN VENEZUELA.
YOU HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT HAS
BEEN ABLE TO CUT $500 BILLION
ENERGY DEAL, 31 MILLION BARRELS
OF OIL ARE NOW MAKING THEIR WAY
TO THE UNITED STATES TO BE SOLD
AND THAT MONEY IS GOING INTO AN
ACCOUNT THAT IS CONTROLLED BY
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.
THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN SUCH
SUCCESS LIKE THIS BEFORE AND IT
IS BECAUSE OF THE CREATIVE
THINKING BUT ALSO THE ACTION OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ENTIRE
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.
WE ALSO KNOW THAT INTRO
AUTHORITIES IN VENEZUELA HAVE
AGREED TO RELEASE THEIR
POLITICAL PRISONERS, WHICH IS
SOMETHING THAT HE HAS SEEN HAS
WANTED TO SEE FOR SOME TIME.
WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF
COOPERATION.
THE PRESIDENT EXPECT THAT TO
CONTINUE.
&gt;&gt; Sandra: FINAL QUESTIONS ON
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FED.
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNED AT THIS
MOMENT BASED ON THE NEW ACTIONS
BY THE OFFENSE TO OPEN A PROBE
INTO THE FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR
JEROME POWELL.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE IT VERY
CLEAR HOW HE FEELS ABOUT THE
FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR AND HIS
ACTIONS WHILE CHAIRING THE FED.
CAN YOU ASSURE THE PARENTS AND
WHERE WILL THIS BE GOING NEXT,
AT THIS PROBE?
&gt;&gt; AS FOR THE CRIMINAL PROBE,
YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
JUSTICE.
I DO KNOW ONE THING IS FOR SURE.
JEROME POWELL HAS PROVEN HE IS
NOT VERY GOOD AT HIS JOB AS TO
WHETHER HE IS A CRIMINAL, THERE
IS AN ANSWER THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE IS GOING TO HAVE TO FIND
AND WHETHER NOT THEY DO, I DO
FOR THAT.
&gt;&gt; Sandra: LET’S FINISH OFF WITH
IRAN BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS
GOING TO BE MEETING WITH HIS
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.
REPORTS ARE THAT HE IS GOING TO
BE WEIGHING OPTIONS ON WHAT TO
DO, PROTECT AGAINST IRAN KILLING
INNOCENT PROTESTERS WHO ARE
SAYING THEY WANT A BETTER
ECONOMY AND SOME OF THEM ARE
CALLING FOR GRISSIM CHANGE.
THE SPEAKER OF IRAN’S PARLIAMENT
OPENLY IN THE PRESIDENT CALLING
HIM ""DELUSIONAL,"" ALSO SAYING IF
YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO COME TO
IRAN, WE WILL DISCIPLINE YOU
WHICH MANY PEOPLE MIGHT FIND
QUITE LAUGHABLE.
BUT THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID THAT
IRAN CALLED AND SAID IT WANTS TO
NEGOTIATE.
CAN YOU PUT A LITTLE MORE MEAT
ON THE BONES OF THAT?
&gt;&gt; ’S COMMENTS YOU JUST REFER TO
OUR LAUGHABLE AND THE EARTH FROM
ONE MEMBER OF THE IRANIAN
REGIME’S ALLEGED PARLIAMENT.
WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THAT ONE
OF THE IRANIAN REGIME IS THING
IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE
MESSAGES THEY ARE SENDING TO THE
UNITED STATES AND THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION PRIVATELY.
PREDATOR AS FOR HIM, HE HAS
ALWAYS EXPRESSED THAT THE POLICY
IS THE FIRST OPTION.
ALWAYS HAS BEEN ALWAYS WILL BE.
HOWEVER, HE IS UNAFRAID TO USE
THE LETHAL FORCE AND MIGHT OF
THE RED STATES MILITARY IF AND
WHEN HE DEEMS THAT NECESSARY AND
NOBODY KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN
THE IRANIAN REGIME.
THE GREATEST LEVERAGE THE REGIME
HAD JUST SEVERAL MONTHS AGO IT
WAS THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM WHICH
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE NSA’S
MILITARY TOTALLY OBLITERATED
THROUGH OPERATION MIDNIGHT
HAMMER.
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL DO
NEXT ONLY HE KNOWS.
THE WORLD WILL HAVE TO KEEP
WAITING AND GUESSING.
AND WE WILL LET HIM DECIDE.
I’M NOT GOING TO BROADCAST ANY
FUTURE OPTIONS FOR DECISION FROM
THE PRESIDENT ON NATIONAL
TELEVISION.

ALERT, THAT VIDEO FROM THE ICE
AGENT INVOLVED IN THIS WEEK’S
SHOOTING IN MINNESOTA SHOWS THE
THREAT THE OFFICER WAS FACING.
&gt;&gt; ISAAC GET YOUR SON SOME
LUNCH, BIG BOY.
&gt;&gt; NOW EVEN CNN IS ADMITTING THE
VIDEO SHOWS THE OFFICER WAS
ACTING IN SELF-DEFENSE.
&gt;&gt; THIS ONE LEADS ME TO BELIEVE
THAT THIS WAS LIKELY A JUSTIFIED
SHOOTING, LEGALLY JUSTIFIED
MEANS A REASONABLE LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, NOT A
REASONABLE PERSON ON THE STREET,
A TRAINED LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICER BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE
IN DANGER OF LOSING THEIR LIFE
OR SUFFERING GRIEVOUS BODILY
INJURIES.
&gt;&gt; JOINING US NOW FOR TONIGHT
BIG CLOSE-UP HIS EYES DIRECTOR
TODD LYONS, DIRECTOR, THANK YOU
FOR BEING WITH US.
I CAN’T IMAGINE WHAT YOU ARE
GOING THROUGH, WE APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING YOU’RE DOING, WHAT IS
YOUR REACTION TO THIS LATEST
VIDEO?
IT’S GOING VIRAL AND FOR GOOD
REASON, A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE,
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT WE ARE
SEEING?
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
TWO REACTIONS, FIRST WORDS
OBVIOUSLY, ANYONE WHO SEES THIS
INCIDENT, OUR HEARTS AND PRAYERS
AND MINDS GOES TO EVERYONE
INVOLVED, NOBODY WANTS TO SEE A
LOSS OF LIFE.
WHAT WE SEE IS SOMEONE WHO PUT
THEMSELVES IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT
SITUATION THAT SHOULDN’T BE
THERE.
THE ICE DIRECTOR I SEE THE VIDEO
AND I SEE OUR OFFICER RELIED ON
HIS TRAINING, HE, YOU CAN SEE IN
THE VIDEO WAS RECORDING THIS
BECAUSE THEY MADE THE CONSCIOUS
DECISION THAT ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH
AND THEY WERE GOING TO ARREST
INDIVIDUALS FOR IMPEDING.
HE HAD THE CAMERA HIS OPPOSITE
STRONG HAND, HE WASN’T IN FRONT
OF THE VEHICLE, HE IS COMING
AROUND TO HELP HIS LOW OFFICER
TO MAKE THE ARREST WHEN THE
INCIDENT HAPPENED AND HIS
TRAINING KICKED IN.
WE SHOOT OUR COURSE OF FIRE FROM
THE ONE AND A HALF YARD LINE IN
QUICK REACTION AND THAT’S WHAT
HE DID.
IT’S CALLED BENT ELBOW SHOOTING
POSITION AND HE SHOT BECAUSE HE
OBVIOUSLY KNEW, HE FELT HIS LIFE

Patrol Chief Greg Bavino. Greg, good to
have you on the program. I want to play
this soundbite from President Trump
yesterday as he departed the White House
because he told me uh that he is not
ready to pull the trigger on the
Insurrection Act. Here he is.
&gt;&gt; Mr. President, what's your trigger for
the Insurrection Act? What's the trigger
for the Insurrection Act in Minnesota?
What are you waiting for? Well, the
Insurrection Act and which has been used
by 48% of the presidents, and if I
needed it, I'd use it. I don't think
there's any reason right now to use it,
but if I needed it, I'd use it. It's uh
very powerful.
&gt;&gt; Do you agree with that assessment, Greg?
Right now, it's not necessary to send in
troops.
&gt;&gt; Aisha, thanks for having me, and it's
good to see you. The president is spot
on with his comments on the Insurrection
Act. Uh the president remains very
focused on what's happening here in
Minneapolis. He relies on uh on the
ground leaders such as me, intelligence
reports, and other information to make
that decision. But he's spot on when he
says right now it's not needed. Uh we've
got the situation under control. Uh
several thousand law enforcement agents
here and we're conducting that Title 8
immigration mission unabated.
&gt;&gt; Oh, you are picking up a lot of
different people that are impeding on
these investigations. Some of them are
breaking into federal vehicles. This one
right here, uh, posted online by the
Department of Homeland Security. His
name is Raul Gutierrez, and he's accused
of destroying FBI vehicles. If we'll put
it up on the screen here. There he is.
Um, and Alexis McAdams, who's been on
the ground reporting for us. She was
telling me that these groups are so
organized, Greg. They're using signal to
track where ICE officers are going.
They're doxing these ICE officers. Do we
know who is organizing these groups?
&gt;&gt; We're digging into the group
organization, who's leading these
groups. The FBI, Homeland Security
Investigations, US Border Patrol are all
working in close concert. We're making
great strides in identifying the ring
leaders and we're going to bring them to
justice. And something else here is it's
not only federal agents and federal
property they're damaging, but they're
also going after American citizens whom
they might think are federal agents and
American citizens say driving an SUV.
They're actually stopping those citizens
on the highway damaging their vehicles,
slashing their tires. So it's not just
federal agents, it's everyday motans
that are feeling the pining from these
anarchists.
&gt;&gt; They're live streaming. I mean, they're
taking pride in what they're doing. I
mean, we want everybody across the
country to see it. Um, are you going to
keep using tear gas and pepper spray now
that this judge has come out and said
you can't use it against peaceful
protesters? I mean, some of these are
not peaceful.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. We're going to continue to use
that minimum amount of force necessary
to accomplish our mission. And we never
did use tear gas or any other less
lethal uh munitions against peaceful
protesters. We support the First
Amendment. We always support the First
Amendment, but they when they cross the
line and they're violent, we will use
those less lethal munitions because it
keeps them safe, it keeps our officers
safe, and it keeps the public safe.
&gt;&gt; So, we know that right now the DOJ is uh
in an active investigation of Mayor
Jacob Fry and the Minnesota Governor Tim
Walls. Um, and this is what Todd Blanch,
the US Deputy Attorney General, uh, told
our Matt Finn when he was asked about
the rhetoric from these two politicians.
Watch.
&gt;&gt; When the governor or the mayor threaten
our officers, when the mayor suggests
that he's encouraging
encouraging citizens to call 911 when
they see ICE officers, that is very
close to a federal crime.
&gt;&gt; I mean, this is what Governor Waltz this
week told residents. I mean, he was
telling them to film ICE. Let's listen
here.
&gt;&gt; I want to share another way you can
help. Witness. Help us establish a
record of exactly what's happening in
our communities. You have an absolute
right to peacefully film ICE agents as
they conduct these activities. So carry
your phone with you at all times.
&gt;&gt; Well, there you go. There's permission
to show up at any activities that ICE
have underway. Greg, do you think that
this is directly the fault of the mayor
and the governor? what we're seeing on
the ground, the chaos that is just so
out of control in Minneapolis.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, 100%. President Trump,
Secretary Gnome, and Todd Blanch are
spot on in investigating that. It should
that should be investigated. And
something else, Aisha, that we're seeing
is that rank and file of many of the
area police departments, including
Minneapolis Police Department. many of
their rank and file police officers are
coming up to our agents on the ground
saying, ""Thank you for what you're
doing. We support you 100%."" That's in
direct direct opposition to say a mayor
fry calling for cops to fight federal
agents. So, we've got the support of the
rank and file and the American public.
Uh, this mission is going to continue.
&gt;&gt; So, they want to help. I mean, they're
coming up to you and telling you that
they actually do want to help, but their
hands are tied.
Exactly. We've seen this in California
and Los Angeles. We saw this with
Chicago rank and file police officers.
And guess what? We're seeing it in
Minneapolis also. And to any of those
Minneapolis police officers, and I'm
hearing this is happening, that want to
join the US Border Patrol or ICE. We
welcome you with open arms. We support
you. We support you making American
cities like Minneapolis a safer place.
So, I'd be happy to meet personally with
those officers. uh that might be wanting
to join a law enforcement agency that
supports them.
&gt;&gt; Greg, how do you get a handle on this? I
mean, it feels like it's never ending
and it continues to get worse and worse
day by day as we go. I remember the
George Floyd riots. I was in the thick
of it all covering it for Fox and that
went on for about a year. I mean, where
is this headed?
&gt;&gt; Sure, Aisha, great question. Um, we do
hard things. Let's take a look in
history at say the Civil War in Abraham
Lincoln or the Revolutionary War in
George Washington. We have Trump doing
equally hard things as they did.
Remember the Civil War did not have a
lot of support at the beginning. Neither
did George Washington in the
Revolutionary War, but they kept the
course. They did the right thing for MPA
America. That's what President Trump's
doing. We're going to continue this
course to rid this country of those vile
criminal illegal aliens that came across
the border by the millions over those
past four years. And we're on the right
track. What a righteous mission this is.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The question that um our reporters
keep asking these protesters is who are
you protecting? I mean, who are you out
here? Name somebody that you're out here
defending that isn't on an ICE detainer.
Uh Greg, good to see you live live from
Minneapolis on the ground there uh with
Border Patrol. Thank you. Aisha, good to
see you. Thank you.

Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","Joining me now is director of ICE Todd
Lions. Director, thanks very much for
being here this morning. I want you to
explain what has taken place here
because based on those comments that we
just saw from those Democrats, it feels
like the Democrats lit the match and now
they're trying to attack the agents who
are doing their job. I mean, let's face
it, these Democrats oversaw a wide open
border where some criminals came in. 350
people on the terrorist watch list were
encountered under Biden's years and then
they told citizens to get in the faces
of ICE when ICE reacted. Now they're
attacking ICE for doing their job. What
is taking place here? Please tell us.
&gt;&gt; Hey Mariam, thanks for having me. So
you're 100% right. So, we started seeing
this back in April and I, you know, I
sent up the flare and started asking,
you know, elected officials not to stoke
such dangerous rhetoric about ICE. And
now, exactly, you know, you are, you
know, seeing exactly what you just said.
You've seen the tax on ICE officers and
our other federal partners for only
going out there and doing their law
enforcement mission. We went to
Minnesota on that criminal fraud case
over $9 billion that, you know, Homeland
Security Investigations and the FBI were
investigating. At the same time, we had
more than 470 criminally illegal aliens
this year alone since President Trump
took office re-released back into the
communities. So, we were out there
focused on getting the worst of the
worst. And if you look at our social
media sites and see our press releases,
you'll see consistently ICE agents and
deportation officers have arrested
murderers, gang members, serial rapists,
people wanted from their home country
for heinous crimes. Yet, unfortunately,
you don't hear that. are automatically
assuming from uh elected officials that
ICE is out there doing something wrong.
And it's horrible for the fact that
people say that ICE is now targeting US
citizens. That's not the case. We have
to send more officers and agents just to
protect the men and women that are out
there trying to do their regular lawful
law enforcement mission.
&gt;&gt; Is there a better way for you to
communicate your priorities? In other
words, that priority is taking down
criminals in this country who are
committing crime who first committed the
first crime of illegally coming into the
country but then have gone on to commit
other crimes because the narrative that
the Democrats are are sending out there
is that ICE is going down breaking up
families taking people who are working
hard having people get a be afraid to go
to work. tell us your priorities and can
you prove to us that in fact your ICE
agents are out there taking down
criminality?
&gt;&gt; 100%. Maria, if you go ahead and you
look at what we've done since January
20th, you know, 70% of all illegal
aliens that ICE has arrested last year
and going into this calendar year have
criminal convictions or pending criminal
charges or warrants or criminal
histories back in their home country.
And you know, we've been focused on
those that have been lawfully ordered,
deported by an immigration judge who
failed to leave. So there's about 1.5
billion individuals in the country that
have been legally and lawfully ordered,
deported, or removed from this country
by a federal judge. Unfortunately, as
much press as we do, as many releases as
we put out, it just no one will pick up
the fact that we are actually out there
focused on our law enforcement mission.
And the one thing we say all the time
is, you know, these sanctuary
jurisdictions, you would not see this
many ICE agents and special agents on
the street focused on the criminal
illegal alien mission if they would just
turn people over to us. That's the key.
These local law enforcement agencies
have already deemed these individuals a
public safety threat and arrested them.
Why not work with federal partners, turn
them over to us, and let us get them out
of our communities? Well, I mean, I'm
I'm I'm wondering if all of these
attacks on our ICE agents have changed
the way these agents are doing their
job. Um, what can you tell us about
that? Is this stopping ICE agents or
changing the way they're doing their
jobs in any way because they're worried
that they're going to be under attack
when they get in the middle of a
situation?
&gt;&gt; You know, Maria, you're you're right in
the fact that it does change the mindset
of the men and women of ICE. Um, you
know, but that's why we have to provide
them so much support. You know, you you
hear about the 3,000 federal officers
and special agents that deployed to
Minneapolis. Majority of those, if not
most, are to protect the men and women
that are out there trying to make those
arrests. And that has definitely changed
our tactics where we would go and have
five to six officers on an arrest team.
Now, you have to go with 10 to 15 just
to protect those individuals that are
trying to arrest a bad guy. In my 30
years of law enforcement, I never
thought we would have to send law
enforcement to protect law enforcement.
But I don't think you'd see as many of
the issues if political leaders were
allowed their local and state law
enforcement to work with us. Great
point. It's it's Yeah, it's never a
public safety issue to uh pit law
enforcement against each other.
&gt;&gt; Of course. Really great point. Todd
Lions, thanks very much for being here
with us. ICE director Todd Lions this
morning. Thank you.

happening there. Garrett, good
afternoon.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Trace, good afternoon. This new
video will be a crucial piece of
evidence in this investigation because
it was recorded by the agent himself and
it shows the events leading up to the
shooting from his point of view. Here is
that entire video.
&gt;&gt; That's fine, dude. I'm not mad.
&gt;&gt; Show your face.
&gt;&gt; I'm not mad at you.
&gt;&gt; It's okay. We don't change our plates

&gt;&gt; You want to come at us?
&gt;&gt; You want to come at us? I said go get
yourself some lunch, big boy. Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Get out of the car.
&gt;&gt; All right.
Vice President JD Vance reacted to this
new video on X, saying, ""Many of you
have been told this law enforcement
officer wasn't hit by a car, wasn't
being harassed, and murdered an innocent
woman. The reality is that his life was
endangered and he fired in
self-defense."" No response to the new
video from city officials, but earlier
today, Mayor Jacob Fry doubled down on
his belief that this was a reckless
abuse of power and that any argument
that this agent feared for his life are
BS. Fox News alert. Breaking details now
on two major news stories we're
following. Let's begin with the unrest
expected today in Minneapolis. We've
seen some a little bit there. The
weather may be pushing back on that.
It's it's severely cold right now. We're
learning more about the woman who was
killed after allegedly trying to ram an
ICE agent with her vehicle. And tensions
are also rising in Portland, Oregon, as
border agents there fired defensive
shots while investigating two people who
were both believed to have ties to
Venezuelan terror gang Tren dear.
Similar to Minneapolis, the driver there
apparently tried to ram ICE agents on
the scene with his car. We've seen this
now a hundred times since Trump took
office, so we know it's a thing. That
man and the passenger were injured in
the event, but their conditions were not
immediately clear. All of this and more
unfolding all throughout this afternoon.
This is Outnumbered. I'm Harris Falner
here with my co-host Emily Compano. Also
joining us today, Donna Runo, Fox News
contributor, criminal defense attorney,
and co-host of the weekly rap sheet on
Fox Nation. Tommy Lren is here, co-host
of the Big Weekend Show and the host of
Tommy Lren is Fearless. Of course she is
on Outkick and Dr. Mark Seagull also
fearless. Fox News senior medical
analyst, professor of med medicine at
NYU Langon Health and the author of the
brand new bestseller, New York Times
bestseller, The Miracles Among Us: How
God's Grace Plays Role in healing.
Well, let's jump right in here, Emily.
And I I I want to go to that news
conference that happened this morning.
Talk to me about how the law works when
the mayor of the city was cussing.
That's not illegal. But talking all
about how it was a murder and setting
the scene and doing the whole thing, but
now says you're not allowed to prejudge.
&gt;&gt; And look, I don't want to conflate
topics today, but right now Luigi Manion
has some motions up for uh judication in
the same city that we're sitting in. And
the arguments presented by his defense
were exactly that point. They claimed
that the administration came out
publicly and said certain damning
things, tainting a potential jury pool
and tainting uh the objective neutrality
of the proceedings. And so now fast
forward to this to yesterday in
Minnesota. And the whole point is we're
seeing this again. So in the same
breath, we have these elected officials
there in Minneapolis, the leadership, I
use quotes because they're anything but.
And they're using in such inflammatory
rhetoric. And when called upon, when
pressed upon it, by the way, the mayor
had, I think, the gall to respond and
say, ""All I did was drop an F-bomb, but
ICE killed someone."" Doubling down that
no one's talking about your use of
profanity, sir. What we are talking
about is the rush to judgment and the
public vilification of ICE that he says
is sewing chaos, disruption, murder,
killing, etc., etc. too many quotes that
we can't even fill or that that we an
hour is not enough to use to quote him
and the governor there that have
absolutely laid a blanket of tone across
the whole United States. And by the way,
for them seeking to have their um
jurisdiction over it, to have the state
weigh in and have their own
investigation, why should anyone trust
their objectivity when clearly the
people they're reporting to are so
obviously biased?
&gt;&gt; But Donna, do we need their their trust?
I mean, do we do we need them as part of
this? I mean, this is a federal
investigation. Are they right or wrong?
They say they have jurisdiction, but do
they?
&gt;&gt; They really don't. They don't have any
real standing. This is an issue that
took place between a federal law
enforcement officer. This is an
investigation that will happen by the
federal government and therefore the
state really doesn't have any standing
unless they were to find that there are
state charges that they can bring. But
in this case, this is not their officer.
This is an officer that works for the
federal government. And if you look back
to the George Floyd situation, which
obviously this all brings up that, you
know, terrible time there, that was a
Minnesota police officer. So that's why
the state jurisdiction took over. And
even though there was a federal
prosecution, separate and apart, this is
different. This is a federal agent.
&gt;&gt; I want to go a different way with you,
Tommy. I I the organization on the
ground and what we're finding out about
this woman who was shot and killed by
ICE agents as she was allegedly ramming
one of them with her car. We know he was
injured. So there's that part. What What
about these far-left groups? I mean,
this woman reportedly now we know was
part of that group. So was her wife,
&gt;&gt; right? Well, how did we get here? Right.
For a decade or more, the left has been
sending out its foot soldiers to do
exactly this. Whether it's antagonizing
regular law enforcement, ICE agents,
border patrol, it it doesn't matter.
This has always been the goal to stalk,
to harass, to antagonize, to assault in
some cases. And then they always have
somebody with a phone in my opinion
because they want to provoke some kind
of an interaction. They want to sew
chaos and they want these officers or
these agents to react so they can get it
on their cell phone, so they can put it
all over social media so they can
demonize law enforcement at large. Now,
this obviously went much further and
it's tragic anytime a life is lost. I
don't think that this woman bargained
for what she got. But you don't put your
vehicle in that position. You don't hit
the gas. You don't again, you don't
resist law enforcement. You don't
disobey law enforcement. If you want to
protest and you want to disagree with
the immigration law, the lawful
immigration laws being enforced. Then
you go to your politicians, you go to
your representatives, or you stand on
the sidewalk and you have a sign and you
scream and you yell. That's fine. You do
not impede a law enforcement action and
then turn around and call it murder when
you try to ram your car into an ICE
agent out there doing their job. Why are
you there? Why does the left want these
people there? Why do they want their
people to be martyed in the streets is
my question.
&gt;&gt; It's a great question. And look, I'm
glad you went there with actually the
preamble to all of this because now we
know, we showed on on the focus last
hour that this woman was in her car for
4 minutes ahead of this incident that
happened, blocking federal agents from
from doing what they were trying to do.
They were trying to carry out a mission
that they had in that block in that area
of South Minneapolis, 34th in Portland.
And so she had been there and they had
been trying to tell her to get out of
the way. and and you see it pull into
view four minutes later. Those agents
still with her trying to, you know, we
need for you to get out of the car. We
need for you to do this. And then, of
course, we know what happened next. It's
all on video.
&gt;&gt; Not to mention all of the reports that
she had a long history of this type of
thing with ICE agents, with her
background in in instigating and and
assaulting or or at least verbally
assaulting ICE agents. that the
background. I can't outdo anything with
these great lawyers on this couch. How
they set this up that a it's a federal
issue and Emily was just amazing about
how we can't be doing trials on this
woman, you know, before she gets to
court. Well, she she's gone, but I mean
this whole situation has to be litigated
not by the left on the streets causing
tremendous rioting. This is the mistake
that's been made before. This is the
mistake that was made with George Floyd.
This is the mistake that's being made
here. It's really dangerous. I want to
make one more point and this is the
point you and I always make, Harris,
which is the mental health issue of what
the ICE agents go through here. I mean,
President Trump's trying to clean up the
situation and get illegals out of the
country before more crimes are
committed. Detention centers are filling
now. Over 60,000 illegals in detention
centers, 30,000 under Biden. And he's
trying to do export exporting. He's
trying to deport people out of the
country. and ICE is trying to do justice
here in this country and they have
tremendous mental health problems as a
result of it which spreads to their
families and instead they're under
attack by the left.
&gt;&gt; Harris, can I emphasize something? And
Donna, keep me honest here about this,
but things can morph into something very
different very quickly. And we know
this. This is why in part we have the
felony murder rule, right? Something,
no, we're just trying to rob a bank and
then someone gets murdered. Well, that
becomes a homicide. My point in bringing
this up is we heard the officers order
that person to get out of car. stop, get
out of the car. That meant it was a
temporary investigative detention. That
meant she was not free to leave. So when
people are sort of couching this and
continue to keep it rest as a protester,
it was anything but in that moment. Now
again, that doesn't, you know, there
there are then more things that occurred
and fleeing is not legally justified in
or is not the a sole legal justification
for killing. But again, all of the
imminent threat stuff that we've been
talking about is. But my point is that
all of a sudden it graduated into a very
different scenario. So regardless of
this person's background or history or
intention even 30 seconds prior, in that
instant it was a subject that was not
free to leave, she was temporarily being
temporarily detained. And in her
attempts to flee put a lot of people in
imminent harm and that's the bottom
line,
&gt;&gt; including her wife and all the people on
the sidewalk behind her as she wretched
her car in reverse like a slingshot and
went forward. I mean yeah icy
conditions. And just this thought too,
those previous four moments were why
police or why, excuse me, the federal
agents, well, they are law enforcement
&gt;&gt; were that's the reason why they were
telling her to stop.
&gt;&gt; That's the reason why they have she was
in, you know, kind of hot water already
before anything happened. D,
&gt;&gt; they were trying to deescalate. That was
the whole point of this. They were
trying to deescalate. And you have to
remember that anytime somebody makes a
choice, there's going to be a reaction.
And she made a lot of choices that day.
She made a choice to go out there to
begin with. She made a choice to try to
block traffic. She made a choice to
disobey orders. And then when she goes
to make the choice to drive away and
actually makes contact with the officer,
what choice does he have at that point?
And I think that's what we have to
remember. And people have gotten so
crazy about the evaluation of this that
they're not willing to just look at the
logical factual history of what
happened. And when we have the ability
to defend yourself as a right to do so
for a reason and he had the ability to
do that and he was put in imminent fear
and followed what you should do in that
situation. They didn't pull out a gun
and start shooting at her while they
were telling her to get out of the car.
This was a situation where this car is
coming at him. We all see the video
&gt;&gt; and it started moments I mean four
minutes before. I mean that and and they
were already trying to as you put it
deescalate. They were doing their jobs
and the one agent who sticks his arm in
the window as the car starts to move. I
mean, this could have been
&gt;&gt; more, you know, dangerous than what it
turned out to be. I mean, it's horrible.
And I agree with you, Tommy. And no
matter how it is, it's a tragedy that
her decisions, this woman's have helped
to lead to this moment. I mean, that
that to lose your life in that way is
horrible. And not but, but and there
were decisions that were poor and put a
whole lot of people in danger
&gt;&gt; for sure. Why does the left keep asking
their foot soldiers to do this? Why are
they putting them in danger? By fmenting
this just foaming at the mouth response,
you're putting more people in danger.
Why do you not care about your own
protesters on the street is my question
&gt;&gt; and then using this as a as an
instigation for even more for expansion
of it.
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Kina.
&gt;&gt; Right. So, we are bringing to you just a
taste of this teachers union press
conference that's being held in
Minneapolis right now. They closed
school yesterday and today they declared
today a day of unity. Uh the woman who
just spoke, Miss Taylor, she said that
every motan is at risk of what happened
to Rachel. Good. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Seems like a little farfetched.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. A couple other things going on.
Day of unity today. Moment of silence
coming up at 10 a.m. Central time, 11
a.m. Eastern time. And last night the
NBA game, the Timberwolves last night,
sold out arena in Minneapolis. They had
a moment of silence as well, followed by
a couple of choice lines for ICE uh and
other federal employees working in their
state. Trisha Mclofflin's DHS secret uh
assistant secretary and thank you for
coming on today. First react to what the
teachers are saying. They want they want
they want all these schools to be in a
safe zone essentially.
&gt;&gt; That certainly did not seem very
unifying and it also didn't seem like
those individuals speaking had the facts
on the ground. Secretary Gnome was just
there in Minneapolis as you both know.
And what we saw as far as arrests go was
they were arresting multiple child
pedophiles. I I've seen the reports of
who they've uh picked up scores and
scores of child pedophiles. These
educators should really be thinking ICE.
And as far as going on the ground, um
our law enforcement does not go into
schools unless there is a public safety
threat within those schools. What we saw
on Wednesday, which one of those
educators was referring to, was there
was an individual who was uh assaulting
our law enforcement, and he started a
chase that went about 5 miles. Uh this
subject of this chase started going over
barriers. Uh he was running red lights,
and eventually he took the chase onto
school grounds. um our law enforcement
did not go into this school and made
sure to diffuse the situation so that so
it was this subject this individual who
put children at risk. It is our law
enforcement and President Trump and
Secretary Nome who are actually
protecting these children um on the
ground in Minneapolis when unfortunately
we see Tim Moss and a lot of these
politicians turning a blind eye uh to
the victims of these crimes to the
children who have been exploited who
have been abused and to also uh other
victims of murder. We had picked up a
known or suspected terrorist multiple
gang members just in the last five weeks
that we've been in Minneapolis. Trisha,
you mentioned Governor Walls and he was
talking last night about Minnesota being
taken out of the investigation. Watch
here.
&gt;&gt; It feels now that Minnesota has been
taken out of the investigation.
It feels very very difficult that we
will get a fair outcome. When Christy
Nome was judge, jury, and basically
executioner yesterday, that's very, very
difficult to think that they were going
to be fair. With that being said,
motans, we've risen to the occasion so
far, but it's going to get challenging.
&gt;&gt; Trisha, has Minnesota been taken out?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely not. And he keeps on talking
about how he feels instead of what the
facts are on the ground. I'll let DOJ
talk about the investigation itself, but
his inflammatory rhetoric are certainly
not helping uh public safety in
Minnesota. But Dan, I also think it's
important we talk about the facts that
happened that day, especially when
lethal force was used. Uh, this
individual, uh, the subject in question,
the deceased, had been following our law
enforcement throughout the day stalking
them. Um, at the time of this incident,
our law enforcement was outside of their
car their vehicle trying to get their
vehicle out of the snow. when she
started blocking our law enforcement,
uh, harassing them, impeding lawful
operations on the ground, that's when
our law enforcement approached the
individual, told her to exit the car to
stop impeding law enforcement. She would
not obey these lawful commands. Um, and
that's when she put her foot on the gas,
and unfortunately, our law enforcement,
he he followed his training, but he did
fire defensive shots. We are glad he's
safe. But with any loss of life, Dana,
of course, uh we pray for the deceased
and her family and our law enforcement,
everyone involved.
&gt;&gt; What what appears to be happening, um
Trisha, is that both sides are lining up
uh to defend their arguments. And we're
seeing this from the teachers union
there in Minnesota. Uh here is
Congresswoman Gyipod out of the state of
Washington. uh just last night on
another network said this.
&gt;&gt; But the truth is that every single
person in the United States of America,
US citizens, white, black, brown,
whoever you are, you have to worry now
that an ICE agent is going to come and
shoot at you and kill you.
&gt;&gt; So, I want you to react to that and also
the numbers that we're getting from your
department. All right, this is from DHS.
The number of assaults up 1300%. Uh
vehicle attacks up 3,200%.
Uh and death threats up 8,000. Trisha,
&gt;&gt; well it's words like that, inflammatory
rhetoric like that from that sitting
congresswoman, which is why we are
seeing a coordinated campaign of
violence against our law enforcement.
You just uh pointed to those statistics
as well as vehicle rammings are up
3,200%.
We've seen 10 just in the last uh 48
hours alone. Incredibly dangerous for
our law enforcement. So, I do think we
have to take a step back and say, why
are we in Minneapolis? Why are we in
these cities across the country? It's
because sanctuary cities like
Minneapolis will not let us in their
jails. So, they'll have murders. They'll
have known or suspected terrorists,
child pedophiles, really vile, violent
public safety threats, and they will
just release them back onto the streets.
In this year alone, um, Governor Walls
and his team have released over 500, uh,
public safety threats who are criminal
legal aliens back onto the streets of
Minnesota. That is why we have to have
law enforcement on the ground to make
sure that those crimes are not are
perpetuated so that we arrest these
individuals and that we make sure that
the citizens of Minnesota are safe
because their law enforcement, excuse
me, their politicians refuse to do it. U
Trisha, I woke to the news about an
incident in Portland regarding the
border patrol. Could you just speak to
what happened there? We understand
somebody was shot.
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, this was a targeted uh traffic
enforcement stop. The target of this
traffic stop uh was a female, 32. She's
a affiliate of Trend Aaragua. She is
involved in a prostitution ring. As many
of your viewers are probably familiar,
Trend Aaru is a gang out of Venezuela.
They enriched themselves uh largely
through drug trafficking but also the
trafficking of young women. This was the
subject was involved in this. She was
the passenger of the vehicle as well as
the driver of the vehicle. He's a we
believe he's a member of Trenagua. Our
law enforcement officers pulled them
over as they were approaching the
vehicle. Uh when they realized when the
subjects realized who our law
enforcement were, they uh pulled forward
attempting to hit our law enforcement.
Um, and that's when our uh agent, he
again followed his training and fired
defensive shots at that vehicle and the
subjects drove five miles and they
proceeded to call 911. They're now in
the hospital. But our agent, he he
practiced and followed his training as
he should have. And we're glad he's safe
today.
&gt;&gt; In the hospital and presumably uh under
arrest as well at this point. Correct on
that.
&gt;&gt; Okay. More to come on this unfortunately
and we'll see what city it happens in.
Thank you for your time today. While
tensions are high in Minneapolis after a
woman was shot dead by an ICE agent, the
Minnesota Bureau of Criminal
Apprehension withdrawing from the
investigation, claiming the feds removed
access to evidence. Here's DHS Secretary
Christy No.
&gt;&gt; The head of Minnesota State
investigations agency said that they
have been cut out of the investigation
into
um can you explain that reversal? I'd
like to know where they've been and why
they're not out on the streets
investigating all of these people that
are harassing and inciting violence on
law enforcement officers right now.
They're allowing this situation to be
volatile. They're not doing their work.
They haven't for years and they have not
been cut out. They don't have any
jurisdiction in this investigation.
&gt;&gt; Here to break it all down, the author of
The Two FBI: The Bravery and Betrayal I
Saw in My Time at the Bureau, Fox News
contributor and former FBI special agent
Nicole Parker joins us now. Nicole, walk
us through this. Does Minnesota, does
the state have any jurisdiction in this
investigation?
&gt;&gt; No. Um, this is a federal investigation.
Federal ICE agents were executing
federal warrants. Therefore, it is
federal jurisdiction. And that would be
the FBI. They would maintain primary
jurisdiction, which would also mean that
the FBI maintains the evidence in the
case. The FBI is always welcome to
invite whoever they would like to help
them with an investigation, but they are
not required to ask anyone for help. And
frankly, if the FBI does not need the
assistance of the locals, then that you
likely will not see that. And that's
what you're seeing in this instance
right now. These violent crime task
force that are set up, for instance, at
the FBI, let's say FBI Minneapolis, I
assume that it would be the violent
crime squad investigating it. We have
task force with locals on our task
forces. if they needed the assistance of
the locals, they can always tap into a
task force officer from a local
jurisdiction. But again, at this point
in time, it does not appear that that is
the case. When there is an assault on a
federal officer, that is under title 18
US code section 111. And that gives the
FBI primary jurisdiction to conduct
these investigations. And my question
is, why are they all of the sudden the
Minnesota, you know, law enforcement and
Tim Walsh is out there, you know, having
a a huge fuss about this? All of a
sudden they want to work with the feds.
They've never wanted to work with the
feds. So all of a sudden they want to
work jointly with the FBI. Where have
they been all of this time? They've
never wanted to work with the feds. But
now when it comes to potentially
investigating an ICE agent, they are all
over wanting to work with the feds. And
if they think that the FBI cannot see
that, they absolutely can. Well, and
that's exactly what's so perplexing,
Nicole, is why the state wants to be
part of investigation after they've
already prejudged this ICE agent as
guilty. Some calling him a murderer.
Here's a little bit of Governor Walls
and Mayor Fry. Listen here. We've been
warning for weeks that the Trump
administration's dangerous,
sensationalized operations are a threat
to our public safety, that someone was
going to get hurt. We do not need any
further help from the federal
government.
To Donald Trump and Christy Gnome,
you've done enough. What ICE is doing is
terrorizing our community. If we're
talking about what's inflammatory, on
the one hand, you got someone who
dropped an Fbomb and on the other hand,
you got someone who killed somebody
else.
So why do the locals want to be part of
this investigation when they are grossly
biased in their approach to whether or
not ICE is at fault here?
&gt;&gt; Again, based on my experience in working
investigations, if there had been a
local officer involved in this shooting,
I could understand why they might, you
know, step in. And I have worked jointly
with other local jurisdictions when it
involves the feds and the locals. But in
this instance, there was no level. They
they did not even want to be there. this
is a sanctuary city. They would not even
provide assistance or backup. The locals
would not even help the feds. And so all
of a sudden, they want this level of
cooperation and to work jointly and they
want to see the evidence. And again,
let's let the FBI conduct their full
investigation. Let's see where the chips
fall. Having been an FBI special agent
who worked violent crime. This is very
serious. They will be looking at the
level of what the agent's perception was
at the time that this incident occurred.
Did the agent have reasonable belief
that the subject posed imminent danger
of death or serious physical injury to
themselves or to another person? Agents
are expected to make split-second
decisions. It's action versus reaction.
It comes down to life or death. And for
anyone to think that a vehicle cannot be
a deadly weapon. It absolutely can.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And the agent involved here has 10
plus years experience on the force, part
of the ERRO's elite SRT team. unclear
whether the fed or the locals would give
it a fair hearing. Nicole Parker, thank
you very much. And make sure to check
out her book, The Two FBI's. It's
available now. Thank you, Nicole.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Fox has learned the woman killed in an
ICE involved shooting in Minneapolis was
an activist who was part of the ICE
watch effort across the city. Here's
Vice President Vance. Listen,
&gt;&gt; you see just with this most recent
terrible incident in Minneapolis, you
see friends of this woman's or other
people who are eyewitnesses saying
basically that she was there to engage
in obstruction of a legitimate law
enforcement operation. How did she get
there? How did she learn about this?
There's an entire network and frankly
some of the media are participating in
it that is trying to incite violent
against our law enforcement officers.
&gt;&gt; Left-wing groups here mobilizing across
the city. Let's bring in Cal
Schneiderler, director for Homeland
Security and Counterterrorism at the
Center for Security Policy. Cal, who is
this group, ICE Watch, and how are they
funded?
&gt;&gt; Well, I think uh the vice president is
absolutely correct to describe this as a
left-wing ecosystem. The reality is that
there are these ICE watch groups in
almost every uh major blue city in the
country where we are seeing these
standoffs between ICE and these
community organization protesters. Uh
and it's actually not that difficult for
these groups to be stood up. Uh you can
find instructions on how to start one of
these groups on the web. uh everything
down to how to use the tactics to block
in uh block in ICE patrols with your
vehicles, how to identify ICE vehicles,
how to track and monitor them, how to
use uh signal encryption and similar
apps uh to share information with other
participants. So the standing up of
these groups is actually not that
challenging. Uh and what is what is
challenging is the training and the
organizing that goes on behind it. the
large national groups uh that know how
to put on a major protest, that know how
to lead people down this path of
radicalization. When the vice president
described uh this woman in Minneapolis
as a victim of that ecosystem, I think
he's right. Also, uh there are people
who are being led into very dangerous
situations um confronting federal law
enforcement, not realizing uh the threat
that that poses. And there are
organizations uh revolutionary
organizations that seek to take
advantage uh when those people are
harmed or killed. And that's what we're
seeing today with uh groups mobilizing
across the country like Party for
Socialism and Liberation, organizing
protests across multiple cities, right?
Uh target this event.
&gt;&gt; And Cal, so we're learning uh Fox has
learned from DHS sources that Renee Good
was an immigration activist. She was
part of this ICE watch. They she was
trained to track, monitor, and interfere
in ICE operations. We're also learning
that she visited at least two other ICE
locations with her car blocking ICE
prior to her her shooting. So, she
clearly was trying to do more than be a
legal observer. She was inserting
herself into ICE operations. My question
is, who is paying for this?
Well, that term legal observer is
interesting because you see it being
thrown around a lot. I think most
Americans don't realize that that is
very coded language. These legal
observers are trained protest
organizers. Uh most often when you see
that term legal observer, it's referring
to groups from the National Lawyers
Guild. That's a longtime communist party
organization that organizes the legal
support for vast uh variety of protests.
uh everything from protests to Antifa to
legitimate terrorist groups uh all get
national lawyers guild support. So I
don't think the American people should
be fooled when they hear that term a
legal observer. All it's really telling
you is that this woman was a
professional protester.
&gt;&gt; Well, and I think it is important that
we follow the money on this one because
these groups are growing from California
to Illinois now in Minneapolis. Cal
Schneiderler, thank you for taking time.
Have a good day.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. US Border Patrol Chief Greg
Bavino is here reacting to all of this.
Uh it's great to see you. Um officer
officer Bavino, am I is that correct or
agent?
&gt;&gt; Asian. Okay. Well, Agent Bavino, it's
great to see you here. It was
interesting to be on the ground today at
the what they call as a vigil and it
seemed like it was a community
gathering. It seemed pretty pro. I mean,
they they don't like us, but fine, but
it seemed fairly peaceful. Although,
man, they policed their border pretty
well there. I mean, they don't they
don't like anyone in their area that
doesn't agree with them, which I found
interesting.
&gt;&gt; Oh, well, Laura, thanks for having me
tonight. But it's very interesting how
intolerant some of those individuals are
when you talk about them policing their
own border. We see that quite often, as
you know, out in the streets here in
Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, New
Orleans, Charlotte, all those places
we've been, we see exactly what you're
talking about.
&gt;&gt; Well, illegal aliens have every right to
be here, but conservatives have no right
to be here. I mean, that's basically it.
&gt;&gt; That's exactly that's what they're
saying. That is what they are saying.
This violent rhetoric, whether it's a
Tim Waltz, uh, Newsome, a Pritser, that
is what they're saying is they're
choosing those illegal aliens over
American citizens and over American law
enforcement is reprehensible. I was told
that um yesterday and I was told this
today by a a 26-year veteran of of the
Secret Service that he has never seen a
time where state and local officials had
not supported the visit of a cabinet
secretary to this state and yesterday
there was no support of the visit of
Christine Gnome who came to address the
the horrible tragedy of yesterday. Is
that is that surprising to you? I mean
you all usually work together. It's
always surprising state and local law
enforcement and federal law enforcement
have traditionally worked together on a
myriad of missions. Whether it's
protecting a cabinet level member coming
or that local law enforcement effort

LET'S GO BACK TO BILL.
BY THE WAY, HE JUST GOT A
STATEMENT FROM I.C.E.
I HAVE A COPY OF IT MYSELF NOW.
BILL, WHAT CAN YOU UPDATE US
WITH, BECAUSE THEY GAVE VERY
SPECIFICS.
I'M LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW.
I'LL LET YOU REPORT ON IT.
&gt;&gt; I JUST GOT THIS LITERALLY 45
SECONDS AGO.
DHS SAYS AT 6:50 CENTRAL TIME
TONIGHT, ""FEDERAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WERE
CONDUCTING A TARGETED TRAFFIC
STOP IN MINNEAPOLIS OF AN
ILLEGAL ALIEN FROM VENEZUELA WHO
WAS RELEASED INTO THE COUNTRY BY
JOE BIDEN IN 2022.
IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE ARREST
THE SUPERINTENDENT FLED THE
SCENE IN HIS VEHICLE AND CRASHED
INTO A PARKED CAR.
THE SUBJECT THEN FLED ON FOOT.
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER
CAUGHT UP TO THE SUBJECT ON FOOT
AND ATTEMPTED TO APPREHEND HIM
WHEN THE SUBJECT BEGAN TO RESIST
AN VIOLENTLY ASSAULT THE
OFFICER.
WHILE THE SUBJECT AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT WERE IN A STRUGGLE
ON THE GROUND, TWO SUBJECTS CAME
OUT OF A NEARBY APARTMENT, AND
ALSO ATTACKED THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WITH A SNOW
SHOVEL AND BROOM HANDLE.
AS THE OFFICER WAS BEING
AMBUSHED AND ATTACKED BY THE TWO
INDIVIDUALS THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT
GOT LOOSE AND BEGAN STRIKING THE
OFFICER WITH A SHOVEL OR
BROOMSTICK.
FEARING FOR HIS LIFE AND SAFETY
AS HE WAS BEING AMBUSHED BY
THREE INDIVIDUALS THE OFFICER
FIRED DEFENSIVE SHOTS TO DEFEND
HIS LIFE.
THE INITIAL SUBJECT WAS HIT IN
THE LEG.
ALL THREE SUBJECTS RAN BACK INTO
THE APARTMENT AND BARRICADED
THEMSELVES INSIDE.
THE ATTACKED OFFICER AND SUBJECT
ARE BOTH IN THE HOSPITAL, BOTH
ATTACKERS ARE IN CUSTODY.
THIS IS ANOTHER ATTACK -- THIS
ATTACK ON ANOTHER BRAVE MEMBER
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOK PLACE
WHILE WALZ AND FREY ARE ACTIVELY
ENCOURAGING AN ORGANIZED
RESISTANCE TO ICE AND FEDERAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
THEIR HATEFUL RHETORIC AND
RESISTANCE AGAINST MEN AND WOMEN
WHO ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO DO
THEIR JOB MUST END.
A VERY LENGTHY STATEMENT BUT IT
SOUNDS A WHOLE LOT MORE
COMPLICATED THAT THIS WAS ONE
PERSON INVOLVED WITH A SHOVEL.
IT SOUNDS LIKE I.C.E. WAS GOING
AFTER A VENEZUELAN ILLEGAL
ALIEN, THAT PERSON CRASHED A
CAR, CRASHED INTO A PARKED CAR,
GOT OUT AND FLED, I.C.E. WAS
CHASING HIM DOWN AND THEN WHILE
THEY WERE WRESTLING ON THE
GROUND, TWO PEOPLE CAME OUT OF A
NEARBY APARTMENT AND STARTED
ATTACKING THE I.C.E. OFFICER
WITH SHOVELS.
AND DURING THAT AMBUSH ATTACK,
THAT'S WHEN THE OFFICER PULLED
OUT HIS WEAPON, FIRED, AND HIT
ONE OF THE SUSPECTS, WHO AGAIN
IS STABLE.
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THE SUSPECTS
ARE IN CUSTODY, AND THIS IS
BEING DESCRIBED TO FOX NEWS FROM
DHS AS YET ANOTHER ATTACK ON
I.C.E. OFFICERS IN MINNEAPOLIS,
SEAN.
&gt;&gt; Sean: BILL, THAT WOULD
CERTAINLY EXPLAIN WHY THE
INDIVIDUAL MIGHT HAVE SHOT THE
INDIVIDUAL IN THE LEG BUT BEING
AMBUSHED AND ATTACKED BY TWO
INDIVIDUALS, THE ORIGINAL
SUSPECT GETS LOOSE, BEGAN
STRIKING THE OFFICER WITH A
SHOVEL OR BROOMSTICK, ANYBODY
WOULD FEAR FOR THEIR LIFE IN
THAT MOMENT.
ALL THREE SUBJECTS RAN BACK INTO
THE APARTMENT, BARRICADED
THEMSELVES, ATTACKED OFFICER AND

HOSPITAL.

THEY ARE NOT ONLY DISAPPEARING

THANK YOU FOR JOINING THE
PROGRAM.
YOU WERE ALWAYS ONE THAT WORKED
FOR BOTH SIDES.
YOU ENDED UP BECOMING AN
INDEPENDENT AND LEAVING THE
SENATE AS A RESULT OF THIS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SOME OF THE
RHETORIC THAT'S OUT THERE RIGHT
NOW, AND GOING AFTER FEDERAL
AGENTS AS A RESULT OF IT?
&gt;&gt; WELSH AS YOU KNOW, I'M AN
ARIZONA NATIVE, AND SO THE WORK
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND DOES
IN ARIZONA IS SO IMPORTANT.
THIS IS REAL FOR US.
THIS MATTERS TO US EVERY DAY.
ICE, THEY DO A VERY IMPORTANT
FUNCTION.
THEY HELP CATCH THE GUYS WHO ARE
VERY DANGEROUS.
FOLKS WHO ARE RAPISTS AND
MURDERERS.
THIS CONTROVERSY IS A REALLY
INTERESTING ONE.
KRISTI AND I SERVED IN CONGRESS
TOGETHER, SO I KNOW SHE
UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF
THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION THAT
CONGRESS PLAYS.
BUT THE TWO BRANCHES ARE
DESIGNED TO BE A CHECK AND
BALANCE ON EACH OTHER.
THEY ARE CO-EQUAL BRANCHES OF
GOVERNMENT.
I'M CONFIDENT THEY WILL BE ABLE
TO WORK OUT AN AGREEMENT WHERE
CONGRESS CAN DO ITS OVERSIGHT
FUNCTION AND GIVE NOTICE FOR
THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE
SERVING OUR COUNTRY TO BE
PREPARED BY THOSE VISITS.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: UNANNOUNCED VISITS
REQUIRE PULLING ICE OFFICERS
AWAY FROM THEIR NORMAL DUTIES.
THERE'S AN INCREASING TREND OF
REPLACING LEGAL ACTIVITIES WITH
A CIRCUS LIKE PUBLICITY STUNT.
&gt;&gt; CONGRESS IS NOT NEW AND
NEITHER IS D.C. TO CIRCUS.
BOTH PARTIES ENGAGE IN THAT
ACTIVITY.
REALITY IS, IF YOU WANT TO DO
GOOD OVERSIGHT, YOU WORK WITH
THE CO-EQUAL BRANCHES OF
GOVERNMENT AND FIND A SOLUTION
THAT ALLOWS YOU DO OVERSIGHT AND
ALSO ALLOW THOSE MEN AND WOMEN
TO DO THEIR JOB.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: THIS IS DHS
RESPONDING TO REPRESENTATIVE
OMAR.
MEMBER OF CONGRESS WERE NOTIFIED
THEIR VISIT WAS IMPROPER AND OUT
OF COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING
COURT ORDERS AND POLICY WHICH
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS MUST NOTIFY
AT LEAST SEVEN DAYS IN ADVANCE
OF CONGRESSIONAL VISITS.
BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT OF
COMPLIANCE WITH THISMENT DATE,
REPRESENTATIVE OMAR AND HER
COLLEAGUES WERE DENIED ENTRY
INTO THE FACILITY.
LET'S MOVE ON TO WHAT'S
HAPPENING WITH AI.
THERE'S A LOT OF BIG THINGS.
&gt;&gt; LOT OF REALLY EXCITING
THINGS.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: SILICON VALLEY AND
THE WHITE HOUSE ARE BETTING ON
AI TO SOLVE THE AFFORDABILITY
CRISIS.
TELL US HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE
MADE POSSIBLE?
&gt;&gt; WE ALREADY SEE THIS
HAPPENING.
THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHT OR SO
COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY THAT
ARE USING AI ROBOTS TO BUILD
HOMES.
YOU WILL START TO SEE THEM
DEPLOYING THIS YEAR.
WE'RE REDUCING THE COST OF HOME
BUILDING BY UP TO 40%.
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A HUGE
DIFFERENCE FOR MIDDLE CLASS
AMERICANS.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: HOW QUICKLY CAN
PEOPLE MOVE INTO THOSE HOMES?
&gt;&gt; SO MUCH FASTER, SO MUCH
CHEAPER.
IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF
THE ZONING ORDINANCES.
MAKES IT SO MUCH CHEAPER AND
FASTER.
THERE'S MORE.
THERE'S AI COMPANIES THAT ARE
HELPING DO MORTGAGE ORIGINATION
REDUCING THE COST FROM 5,000 TO
$3,000.
FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY
THESE ARE HUGE SAVINGS.
IMAGINE YOU'RE GOING TO BUY YOUR
FIRST HOME AND YOU SEE THE COST
REDUCED BY 40% AND THE COST OF
ORIGINATING YOUR LOAN REDUCED BY
SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLAR.
HUGE SAVINGS.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: YOU STILL SEE WITH
AI CONSTRUCTING THESE HOMES YOU
STILL SEE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS
AT THE SITES AS WELL.
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: THE FEAR THAT THEY
WILL BE REPLACED, THEY'LL ONLY
MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
JUST LIKE WHEN THE INTERNET CAME
ON BOARD AND PEOPLE THOUGHT, OH,
WE'RE GONNA LOSE JOBS.
WE ACTUALLY CREATED MORE JOBS.
HUMANS WILL ALWAYS BE INVOLVED.
WE HAVE TO DIRECT THE PROCESS.
WE SEE THIS EVERYWHERE, RIGHT?
WE SEE IT IN MEDICINE.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: THAT'S RIGHT.
MEDICINE USES AI.
MY DENTIST IS STILL THERE.
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE, CHAT

MAYOR FREY WE WILL SET ASIDE, HE
IS WAFFLING ALL OVER THIS THING.
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO SUPPORT
I.C.E. BUT YET THIS I.C.E. IS
BAD AND HE WANTS I.C.E. TO GET
THE F OUT.
BUT GOVERNOR TIM WALZ, OVER THE
HOLIDAYS HE WAS WARNING THAT
I.C.E. WOULD BE COMING INTO
MINNEAPOLIS AND WOULD BE DOING
MIDNIGHT MASS RAIDS ON
IMMIGRANTS AT CHURCH SERVICES.
HE SAID ""BECAUSE THAT’S WHO THEY
ARE.""
AFTER COMPARING I.C.E. TO NAZIS.
GUESS WHAT?
HE SAID NO COMMENT ABOUT THE
ANTI-I.C.E. AGITATORS BREAKING
FEDERAL LAW BY OBSTRUCTING AND
ASSAULTING FEDERAL OFFICERS
GOING INTO THE CHURCH.
IT’S NOT I.C.E. THAT WENT INTO
THE CHURCH, IT IS THE CROWD HE
INCENSED THAT WENT INTO THE
STORAGE AND IT’S A DESPICABLE
SCENE.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS JUST HORRIBLE.
YOU GOING TO CHURCH TO PRAY AND
ASK FOR FORGIVENESS, TO SET YOUR
WEEK IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ON
THE RIGHT TONE, EVERYTHING IS
PEACEFUL, IT’S ABOUT LOVE AND
KINDNESS AND SPREADING THE
GOSPEL, AND WHEN YOU HAVE THESE
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE YELLING AND
SCREAMING AND GETTING IN
PEOPLE’S FACES, THIS IS JUST TOO
FAR.
THIS IS NOT PEACEFUL, AND THEY
ARE WALKING IN, STORMING INTO A
HOUSE OF WORSHIP, AND IT IS JUST
PLAIN WRONG.
I WOULD BE SCARED TO GO TO
CHURCH NEXT WEEK IF I WERE IN
THAT AREA.
IS THIS A TREND NOW, SOMETHING
THEY’RE GOING TO START DOING?
&gt;&gt; THE PASTOR CAME OUT AND
STARTED TO ENGAGE THEM BUT THEY
JUST KEPT SCREAMING AT HIM
BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T WANT TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION.
SO HE WAS READY TO ENGAGE PEOPLE
THAT BARGED INTO THE CHURCH.
BY THE WAY, IN TODAY’S SECURITY
ENVIRONMENT, DIDN’T HAVE A
SITUATION WHERE THEY BARGED INTO
A CHURCH LIKE SIX MONTHS AGO AND
STARTED SHOOTING PEOPLE?
THE MINUTE YOU SEE THUNDEROUS
NOISE COMING FROM THE BACK OF
THE CHURCH, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
THINKING THE WORST.
AND SECURITY, YOU WOULD THINK
THEY’D BE AT THE CHURCH, BUT
THEY STARTED SCREAMING.
THIS IS ALL SCRIPTED, ALL
PLANNED.
JUST LIKE THEY GO OUT OF THEIR
WAY TO FOLLOW YOU WITH THE APPS
TO FIND OUT WHAT HOTELS I.C.E.
IS STAYING IN, NOW THEY ARE
GETTING SOME ANY COMPLAINTS, I
CAN’T HAVE I.C.E. AGENTS HERE
BECAUSE ALL THE PROTESTERS COME,
AND MY OTHER CUSTOMERS ARE
COMPLAINING.
SO THIS IS WHAT THEY WANTED.
THEY WANTED TO CREATE CHAOS.
BUT TELL ME HOW THIS RESONATES
WITH MOST OF AMERICA.
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT IF YOU ARE IN CHARGE
WITH YOUR CHILDREN?
I WOULD BE PANICKING RIGHT NOW
SITTING HERE.
I WOULD HIT THE FLOOR AND TRY TO
GET OUT OF THERE WITH MY CHILD.
I WOULD BE SCARED.
&gt;&gt; BUT YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE
HEAD, AINSLEY.
YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE SCARED TO
GO TO CHURCH IN ST. PAUL AND
MINNEAPOLIS, NOT BECAUSE OF
I.C.E. RATING IN THERE, WHICH IS
WHAT WALZ WAS WARNING ABOUT, BUT
BECAUSE OF THE ANTI-I.C.E.
AGITATORS HE HAS POURED GASOLINE
ON, HEALING.
THE FACT THAT WE KEEP HEARING
GOVERNOR WALZ CALLING FOR PEOPLE
TO DOCUMENT THE ATROCITIES, THAT
THERE IS AN INVASION AND THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THIS IS A
DANGEROUS NARRATIVE AND IT IS
LEADING TO ACTUAL VIOLENCE IN
SITUATIONS LIKE WE JUST WATCHED.
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.
I THINK IT IS INEVITABLE THOSE
1500 TROOPS ARE GOING TO COME
DOWN.
HE IS NOT LETTING THE COPS HELP,
SO WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?
TWO OR 3,000 I.C.E. AGENTS,
THERE’S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT HE’S
GOING TO BRING THOSE TROOPS DOWN
FROM ALASKA.
&gt;&gt; BUT THE MAYOR SAID TO
DONALD TRUMP, WE DON’T NEED MORE
FEDERAL AGENTS TO KEEP PEOPLE
SAFE.
WE ARE SAFE.
DOES THAT LOOK SAFE TO YOU?
DO YOU WANT TO STAND IN THE
MIDDLE OF THAT?
DO YOU WANT TO BE IN CHURCH
SERVICE WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
COMING IN AND SCREAMING?
&gt;&gt; HE GOES, I’M SO PROUD OF
MINNEAPOLIS STANDING UP FOR OUR
SOMALI NEIGHBORS.
THE SIMILE NEIGHBORS ARE FINE.
IF THEY ARE HERE LEGALLY.
IF THEY ARE NOT HERE LEGALLY,
THEY’RE GOING TO GO.
THAT’S IT.
IT DOESN’T MATTER.
AND THEN YOU SAY, A LOT OF THE
NEIGHBORS ARE PITCHING IN AND
GOING SHOPPING BECAUSE PEOPLE
ARE AFRAID TO GO SHOPPING.
YOU SHOULD ONLY BE AFRAID TO GO
SHOPPING IF THERE’S A WARRANT
OUT FOR YOUR ARREST OR IF YOU
ARE HERE ILLEGALLY.
IF THEY ARE HELPING THEM OUT,
YOU’RE HELPING THEM STAY IN YOUR
CITY ILLEGALLY, IT’S AGAINST THE
LAW.
&gt;&gt; VALERIE HARWELL IS A WOMAN IN
2024 THAT WAS KILLED BY A DRUNK
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT IN MINNEAPOLIS
THAT WAS FROM ECUADOR.
HE WAS TWICE RELEASED ON THE
STREETS.
I.C.E. WENT AND GOT HIM JUST
MONTHS AGO BECAUSE THEY TARGETED
THE ACTUAL DANGERS TO THE
COMMUNITY.
YOU DON’T HEAR -- I ASK
JACOB FREY ABOUT MS. HARWELL AND
HE HAD NO IDEA WHO SHE WAS.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU
CANNOT DIVORCE THE FACT THAT
THIS ISN’T JUST OUT OF NOWHERE.
THIS IS BECAUSE, IN SANCTUARY
CITIES, THEY ARE DANGEROUS AND
IN MANY CASES VIOLENT CRIMINAL
ILLEGAL ALIENS ON THE STREETS
AND THIS ADMINISTRATION IS
TRYING TO ROUND THEM UP AND
DEPORT THEM BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW UPHOLDS.
&gt;&gt; STEALING PAPERWORK FROM THE
FBI VEHICLE, DEFILING IT,
STEALING IT, AND THEY TOOK THE
GUN SAFE FROM THERE.
I DON’T KNOW HOW THAT FOOTAGE
DIDN’T END UP ON SUNDAY SHOWS.
IF YOU GO ON X YOU CAN SEE ALL
THE ATTACKS ON I.C.E.
FOR THIS MAYOR TO NOT BE
CONFRONTED BY THIS FOOTAGE IS
RIDICULOUS.
OR THE GOVERNOR.
&gt;&gt; AND WE ARE FOCUSING SO MUCH
ON MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, THE
STATE IS NOT ONLY DEALING WITH
THESE PROTESTS, THEY ARE DEALING
WITH SO MUCH FRAUD, TOO.
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE, AND WE CAN CONNECT
SOME DOTS.
YOU JUST SAW DR. OZ AND THE
CALIFORNIA U.S. ATTORNEY OUT"

Tom Holman. Tom, it's great to see you
tonight. Um, the Minnesota politicians
will say often as Fry does, and we're
going to get into him a little bit later
on, but Fry and Walt, they'll say,
""Well, we want calm. We want we want we
want the temperature to come down."" And
then they egg on the violence. They
continue to do this night after night.
And as you saw, Tom, it's getting worse
night after night.
&gt;&gt; It is. And just before I got in front of
the camera, my security team advised me
that the person that stole that farm
last night is now wearing a set of
handcuffs in custody. So, I was just
advised that before I got on the camera.
So, and there's others we're others are
coming. So, uh they're going to be held
accountable. But you're right. Look,
Mayor Fry and the governor could end
this right now. They could say, ""ICE, we
want to work with you. ICE, we're going
to let you into our jails and we're
going to we're going to, you know,
respect your detainers. Any illegal
alien that we book into a jail. When
we're done with them, we're going to
call you so you can arrest them in the
safety and security of a jail rather
than us releasing them to the street.
Then you got to send a whole team to
look for them. They could fix this
situation right now because as of right
now, what are these, you know, these
anarchists, what do they have achieved
so far? What have they achieved? Has ICE
decreased their operations? No, we
doubled down. We're arresting people
every day and we'll keep doing it. They
haven't achieved anything other than
violence.
&gt;&gt; Well, Tom, I I also think what's clear
here is that the money trail has to be
dried up. That has to be exposed. I know
there's some reporting around the edges
about some foundations perhaps connected
to billionaires we've been talking about
are giving some type of support for some
of these groups that may filter into
these protests. Um but the idea that
this is some organic uprising is
ludicrous. I was there. It was obvious.
It was not organic.
&gt;&gt; Well, you're exactly right. And uh
there's deep dive right now between HSI,
IRS, and FBI. We know there's organized
groups. We know there's funding, and
we're doing a deep dive right now to
identify them, follow the money, and
find out who's organizing this, who's
inciting the violence, and justice is
coming their way. So, we're all over
this. Uh we just uh increased number of
attorneys to Minnesota, number of
agents, but a separate part than that,
we're looking at the financials. We're
looking at who's who's funding this,
who's who's who's antagonizing this, and
they'll be held accountable. Laura,
we're all over it. You should see you
should hear something real soon.
When Governor Wall said for citizens to
track ICE,
film them, and record their quote
atrocities for future prosecution. And
then you hear the Philly uh police chief
uh looked like a comic uh comedy sketch
when she was up there talking about,
""Oh, we're going to, you know, we'll
arrest ICE if we have to. We'll arrest
the agents. If you come into our town,
you're going to get arrested
essentially."" I'm paraphrasing. Uh
what's your response to them tonight?
&gt;&gt; Well, the Philly sheriff, she she's
proven she's not too smart. I mean, uh
you're not going to arrest anybody. Like
you said earlier in your monologue,
there's supremacy calls. If you
interfere or impede ICE officers, I
don't care if you're wearing a badge or
not. You just committed a felony. So,
we're going to continue doing this this
job and and these people who want to who
want to, you know, say follow ICE, you
know, and film ICE. You know what? You
can protest. They have that right. But
when you cross that line, and we've
proven it, if you interfere or impeached
or assault an ICE officer, you will be
prosecuted. And one thing I'm pushing
for right now, Laura, we're going to
create a database. We're those people
that are arrested for interference in PE
assault, we're going to make them
famous. We're going to put their face on
TV. We're going to let their employers
in their neighborhoods, in their
schools, know who these people are. Cuz
as you said, a lot of these people, they
say they're taking time off work to
protest. I bet you a lot of them are
calling in sick. I bet you a lot of
their employers don't know what they're
doing. But we're going we're going to
make sure everybody knows who they are.
We're going to broadcast. They want to
broadcast the ICE officer, those nearly
killed, all over the internet. We're
going to broadcast every one of these
people we arrest.
&gt;&gt; Tom, uh, what's the status of the agent
who was ambushed last night, his medical
status?
&gt;&gt; Well, I talked to him. He's he's
he'saling and he's under medical care.
Uh he's in a secure location, not
because he's afraid because of the death
threats against his family, but I'm I'm
glad he's in a secure location because I
myself have seen plenty of intelligence
reports that a lot of people want him
dead. They want his family dead. So he's
in a safe place right now healing up,
getting medical attention.
&gt;&gt; Uh three three Venezuelan illegals
attack him and they want him dead.
Has has Mayor has Mayor Fry or Tim Waltz
reached out to his family? Absolutely
not. Absolutely not. I mean, the bottom
line is again that, you know, have they
rent with the Angel family and all these
people protesting what's happening in
Minneapolis. Where were they when Lake
and Riley was, you know, brutally
murdered or or we can go, you know, how
many young women have been raped and
murdered and brutally killed? Where was
all the anger then? And I I talked an
angel mom today and she's upset because
no one was protesting her daughter's
death when she was raped and murdered by
an illegal alien. It's just it's
incredible where we're at today as a
nation. I I'll say it again and I mean
it. I think the difference right now is
these these these politicians, they hate
Trump more than they love their
communities because if they really love
their communities, they'd be working
with take these public safety threats
off the street. They didn't want to give
President Trump a win. I got news for
him. President Trump's winning every
day. Every criminal illegal animal we
take off the street makes this country
safer and we're not going to stop.
Tom, are you concerned about the CNN and
Quinnipic polls that showed declining
public support for ICE and President
Trump's approach to immigration
enforcement? Do you think those are
accurate? Are they being egged on by the
press?
&gt;&gt; I think being egged on by the press. I
think there's a lot of false media out
there and I think we need to be better
at messaging what we're doing. Look,
bottom line is 70% of everybody arrested
as a criminal. We need to start
advertising that every single day and
putting their pictures all over social
media and and you know the bottom line
is if if people listen to most of the
media, not not this network, they're
going to hear that ISIS separating
families every day. We're deporting US
citizen children. We're we're we're
doing, you know, operations in
elementary schools and churches and
hospitals. We just got to push back the
lies because I think a lot of people
don't get the facts and we got to be
better at getting the facts out there.
&gt;&gt; And Tom, we're showing live pictures
from Minneapolis and and we know our
viewers are are concerned about that
ambush uh and the state of that agent.
And our viewers are wondering whether
you learned anything else about how the
ambush took place or what he told you
about it that you might share tonight.
Uh, I can't share anything more on
ongoing investigation, but the agents,
like again, the agents, thank God he's
alive and and he's healing up. So, uh,
you know, it's it's a travesty. I mean,
Laura, I'll say it again. I said a few
weeks ago on your show, if the hateful
reic doesn't stop, there's going to be
more bloodshed. It's not over. And what
what scares you the most, there's going
to be another death either of an agent
or or or
somebody that's, you know, steps over
that line. I buried bord patrol agents
throughout my career. I buried uh
special agents. The worst thing I've
ever done in my career is handed a
folded flag to a spouse or a child. I
pray every night that I never have to do
that again.
&gt;&gt; Tom, is it time for the insurrection act
or would that just add gasoline to the
fire?
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to get ahead of the
president on that, but it's certainly an
option uh a viable option. So actually
I'll be meeting with the president
tomorrow. So you know I I think it's
something that needs to be on the table
because this cannot continue. There is
going to be more bloodshed. I'm telling
you I hope I'm wrong but I have
&gt;&gt; there's going to be more bloodshed if
something isn't done.
&gt;&gt; It's going to spread and it's and most
min mo most motans by the way and I want
to say this tonight because they folks
have reached out to me support ICE. It's
this radical group of anarchists and
when you see them close up, you really
get a sense of who they are. It's this
crowd, a lot of them paid, a lot of them
working, you know, double shifts of
protest against the rest of the state,
which is are reasonable, common sense,
peaceful people of all backgrounds,
including immigrant backgrounds. They
don't like what's happened in the Twin
Cities. And we're going to expose more
about Jacob Fry in a moment, but Tom, I
think most people are good people. They
just want they want the bad people out
and they want some peace in their
neighborhoods
&gt;&gt; and we're going to get the bad people
out. And as far as the organization,
everybody that's, you know, planning
these protests, you know, giving these
people weapons and funding this again,
justice is coming because we're deep
diving that whole thing.

flood Minnesota, DHS is now deploying
hundreds of more federal agents to
combat the riers in that state.
&gt;&gt; Matt Finn joins us live in Minneapolis
with the details. Hey, Matt.
&gt;&gt; Good morning. DHS sources tell Fox up to
1,000 additional agents will surge the
Minneapolis area. That's on top of the
already 2,000 agents that are here. But
the Democratic mayor, Jacob Fry, says
these agents are going to be met with
resistance.
&gt;&gt; We have thousands and hundreds of
thousands of people that are standing up
for their neighbors right now. We have
people that are not taking the bait of
this Trump administration because they
all know, we know they're looking for
any excuse to come in with greater force
and occupy our city. We're grinning down
this bear. We are doing right by our
city and the people in it, and we're not
backing down.
Now, cell phone video from the ICE
officer who fired the deadly shot at
Renee Good seems to show Rene's wife
taunting the agent moments before
telling her wife to drive off.
&gt;&gt; I say, ""Go get yourself some lunch, big
boy. Go ahead.
Get out.
Get out OF THE CAR.""
AND DHS SECRETARY CHRISTY NOOM IS
standing by the ICE officer who fired
the shots and killed Renee Good in what
Noom calls domestic terrorism in Mayor
Fry City.
&gt;&gt; If you look at what the definition of
domestic terrorism is, it completely
fits the situation on the ground. This
individual, as you saw in the video that
we released just 48 hours after this
incident, uh showed that this officer
was hit by her vehicle. She weaponized
it and he defended his life and those
colleagues around him and the public.
Also, new video leading up to the
moments of Renee Good's shooting death
by an ICE agent on Wednesday.
&gt;&gt; Video appears to show Renee Good's SUV
parked in the street, honking the horn,
and possibly taunting officers, even
dancing in the driver's seat. Now,
Border Patrol tells us it's dangerous
for agents to be blocked in by a car
because there are so many anti-ICE
agitators who quickly surround them.
Also, new video from late yesterday
apparently shows federal agents using
crowd control tactics, firing tear gas
and pepper balls at protesters outside
the federal building where ICE detainees
are being held. An independent
photographer who was there says
protesters tried to stop traffic in and
out of the federal facility. Now, Fox
News did a ride along with Border Patrol
here. We saw cars trailing agents for
miles around the city, even after the
shooting death of Renee Good. One car
even intentionally blocking in federal
agents. At one point, Border Patrol
warned two women to stop trailing them.
&gt;&gt; You could if I continually see you
following us, interfering with us,
honking your horn, blocking our cars,
[music]
&gt;&gt; you have a very high probability of
making a really bad decision and being
arrested today. Okay.
&gt;&gt; I think I'm making the right decision.
So, you heard Mayor Fry say that there
are thousands and thousands of people
protesting and resisting against ICE
here. During the ride along, we saw that
in real time. You know, as soon as these
border patrol agents get out of their
car to apprehend anyone or question
anyone, they're surrounded by people
with those earpiercing whistles. Uh, and
so there are neighborhood watches here
uh for uh immigration agents and they
are in full effect in Minneapolis right
now. Back to you guys in New York. All
right, thanks Matt. Uh what's happening
is unacceptable and what they're
obstructing because ISIS released some
of the people that they have arrested uh
that they claim to be watching these
protesters. U so someone was convicted
of homicide, a Burmese national, they
got arrested by ICE, a Guatemalan
illegal alien in the country, wanted for
homicide, already committed homicide,
was arrested, attempted homicide from
someone from Sudan, a Somalian convicted
of manslaughter, a Mexican illegal
convicted of homicide. two counts of
homicide, serial Leon uh two uh
conviction of uh homicide alluration and
Sudan National convicted of homicide,
rape against a child. I mean, the list
goes on and on and on and these guys
that are in the middle of the street uh
in including tragically uh the woman
that lost her life the other day because
she tried to ram an officer um are all
pres preventing ICE from doing their
job, arresting those people. So, they're
protecting those criminals%
&gt;&gt; instead of protecting the law
enforcement uh who's out there trying to
make Minnesota safer. Homeland Security
Secretary Christine Gnome, she announced
an updated restriction on the
congressional visits to these ICE
detention facilities because she says
when these lawmakers go in unannounced,
it creates unsafe conditions for the
lawmakers and for the ICE agents. And
she said they're all trying to get in
these detention centers. It's a
circus-like publicity stunt rather than
legitimate oversight. So lawmakers now,
if they want to go into one of the ICE
facilities, they have the right to do
that. They just have to notify a week in
advance, seven days in advance. And on
Saturday, there were three House
Democrats, including Ilhan Omar and
Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, who were
Democrats um from Minnesota. They were
denied entry into a facility in
Minnesota. And this is what Ilhan Omar
said. And when people are disappeared in
the darkness, American democracy dies.
&gt;&gt; Congresswoman,
&gt;&gt; and it is really important for every
single person in this country to
understand that they are not only
disappearing people who have committed
crimes who are in this country
undocumented. They are disappearing US
citizens.
&gt;&gt; Of course, all that those are just lies.
and uh Ilhan Omar and other politicians
who have uh fermented all of this and
encouraged people to go out and uh get
involved and disrupt these uh actions,
ICE actions. Um I I would argue have
blood on their hands. Um this is uh you
know, these agents are they're not there
because they feel like it or because
they want to be there. They're there
because they have a constitutional
responsibility to enforce the law. That
is why they are there. And if Ilhan Omar
has a problem with the laws, she can go
and change the laws. Uh Lawrence, you
spoke earlier with former Senator uh
Kirstston Cinema, and I thought that she
had a very um a very basic but a very
important point about uh the two side
about the executive branch and the
legislative branch working out their
differences.
&gt;&gt; I'm an Arizona native and so the work
that the Department of Homeland Security
does in Arizona is so important because
this is real for us. This matters to us
every single day. And ICE, they they do
a very important function. They help
catch the guys who are very dangerous,
you know, folks who are rapists and
murderers and get them out of the
country. Congress is not new and neither
is DC to circus-like publicity stunts,
right?
&gt;&gt; We've seen those for years. And look,
both parties engage in that activity.
The reality is is if you want to do good
oversight, you work with the co-equal
branches of government and and find a
solution that allows you to do oversight
and also allow those men and women to do
their jobs.
&gt;&gt; I would say real quickly, Angley, is
that my concern right now is less with
the elected officials and their stunts
because she is right. Both parties do
stunt, but the elected officials are
giving marching orders to these
protesters that are breaking the law and
putting themselves in very dangerous
situations. When you start impeding,
when you start ramming at officers, you
put yourself in your life at danger.
There's certain protocols that you need
to uh uh conduct yourself when you're
approached with law enforcement,
especially when you've already broken
the law. So you can't go around the
whole day follow following law
enforcement using your vehicle to
obstruct and then when a cop comes by
the way those cops didn't even have
their guns drunk. One of the cops that
was actually fired a shot had his film
recording what was going on. So if they
come to you peaceful and say look you
keep doing this you're going to get
yourself arrested. Maybe you should
comply with those commands. That's not
saying you can't protest but go on the
sidewalk. Don't be in the middle of the
street. Well, the White House uh Abigail
Jackson says Somali fraudsters were
stolen have stolen millions, it's
actually billions, from hardworking
Minnesota taxpayers, while Democrats
looked the other way. Now they are
desperately trying to distract from
their failures with political stunts.
&gt;&gt; So true. Truly incredible.

&gt;&gt; Sean: CHAD WOLF,
JASON CHAFFETZ, THANK YOU BOTH.
DURING HIS NOW, FOX NEWS LEGAL
ANALYST GREGG JARRETT.
WE HAVE THIS VIDEO, WE WILL
RERACKET AND SHOW IT AND WE WILL
KEEP OUR LIFE PICTURES UP, AND I
WANT YOUR LEGAL ANALYSIS.
TO ME IT IS CUT AND DRY.
HOWEVER, THERE ARE PEOPLE TRYING
TO MAKE THE CASE, THIS WOMAN DID
NOTHING WRONG HERE.
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO IT FROM
A LEGAL STANDPOINT?
&gt;&gt; HE MADE POOR CHOICES, AND
THAT CAN SOMETIMES END
TRAGICALLY.
IN THE VIDEO, SEAN, IT APPEARS
TO CORROBORATE WHAT THEY SAID,
THAT THE DRIVER AND WIFE WERE
BLOCKING I.C.E. VEHICLES.
PART OF THE RESISTANCE, SHE WAS
TOLD REPEATEDLY TO GET OUT OF
THE CAR.
SHE REFUSED AND INSTEAD GUNNED
THE ACCELERATOR WITH THE OFFICER
IN FRONT OF HER OR
IN FRONT OF HER OR 
PERPENDICULAR.
AND IT LOOKS AND SOUNDS LIKE HE
WAS STRUCK BY THAT VEHICLE.
CONTRARY TO WHAT CRITICS LIKE
MAYOR FREY AND TIM WALZ HAVE
CLAIMED.
REMEMBER, AUTOMOBILES OR
DANGEROUS WEAPONS.
SO THE ARGUMENT FOR JUSTIFIABLE
SELF-DEFENSE SEEMS CREDIBLE, BUT
OF COURSE IT'LL BE UP TO
PROSECUTORS TO EVALUATE ALL OF
THE EVIDENCE.
BUT THEIR CENTRAL QUESTION WILL
BE THIS: DID THE OFFICER
REASONABLY BELIEVED HE WAS IN
IMMINENT DANGER OF HARM OR
DEATH?
AND THE LEGAL TEST IS NOT
OBJECTIVELY WHAT A REASONABLE
PERSON WOULD DO, NO.
IT IS WHAT THIS OFFICER
SUBJECTIVELY FELT AT THAT VERY
MOMENT THAT HE ACTED, GIVEN HIS
PERCEPTIONS, AND HIS PAST
EXPERIENCES, WHICH REPORTEDLY
INCLUDE BEING HIT OR DRAGGED
ONCE BEFORE.
AND THERE IS ONE OTHER DEFENSE
HERE: AN IMPERFECT SELF-DEFENSE.
AN HONEST BUT MISTAKEN BELIEF OF
HARM CONSTITUTE SELF-DEFENSE.
&gt;&gt; Sean: DO YOU HAVE ANY
DOUBT?
BECAUSE I DOUBT IT.
WHEN THE WOMAN WAS NOT LISTENING
TO POLICE COMMANDS TO STOP AND
GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE, AND THEN
SHE BACKED UP, AND SHE
ACCELERATED, THERE IS NO DOUBT
SHE ACCELERATED RIGHT IN THE
DIRECTION OF THAT OFFICER.
NO DOUBT AT ALL AFTER SEEING
FROM MANY ANGLES, WATCHING IT
MANY TIMES.
IN THAT CASE I THINK IT'S CUT
AND DRY.
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF THE
FEDS LOOKING INTO IT.
I DOUBT THERE WILL BE CHARGES.
STATE CHARGES, POTENTIALLY.
&gt;&gt; THE STATE MAY TRY TO BRING
CHARGES.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
THE FEDERAL OFFICER IS IMMUNE
FROM STATE PROSECUTION AS LONG
AS HE IS ACTING WITHIN THE SCOPE
OF HIS LAWFUL FEDERAL DUTIES.
STOPPING A MOTORIST WHO IS
OBSTRUCTING I.C.E., THAT IS A
LAWFUL DUTY.
AND ALSO FEDERAL OFFICERS, AS
YOU POINTED OUT EARLIER IN YOUR
MONOLOGUE, THEY DO HAVE A SHIELD
TO THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE WHICH
GIVES FEDERAL LAW PRIORITY OVER
STATE LAW.
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT
MINNESOTA'S CENTURY POLICIES
CONTRIBUTED TO THIS.
HE REFUSED TO ASSIST I.C.E. IN
ENFORCING LAW, THEY ACTIVELY
INTERFERED, THEY ONLY ENCOURAGED
ACTIVISTS LIKE THESE TO DO THE
EXACT SAME THING, AND TR"

Follow Fox News on X: https://x.com/foxnews
Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","All right, joining us now with the
reaction is White House uh Deputy Press
Secretary Anna Kelly. Uh thank you for
joining us tonight. Listen, I I've got
two eyes. I think that's something that
Mayor Frey said in one of his attacks.
If we have two eyes, we can see. It's
obvious that everyone sees what they
want to see or see something different,
I guess. But for me, it's pretty clear
when you see the video. There's nothing
to cover up. It's just rather not when
you see it, you see self-defense or I
guess preemptive strike.
Well, that's right. And I'll also add,
let's be very clear about which party
likes to jump the gun because I think
it's absolutely shameful when you had
this uh officer involved shooting uh and
dating all the way back to this
beginning of this administration, the
fact that Democrats like this senator
are always so quick uh to vilify law
enforcement. That includes our brave men
and women in ICE. And let's remember why
ICE is there. because uh Democrat
politicians like the senator, like Tim
Waltz, uh totally failed to uh hold our
immigration laws to hold these illegal
alien criminals accountable. And they
have sanctuary city policies in
Minneapolis that basically handcuff
local law enforcement and their ability
to work with ICE uh and deport illegal
alien criminals from our communities.
And so it's absolutely shameful that you
have this horrific rhetoric from this
senator uh which is by the way part of
the reason why we have increased attacks
on ICE and law enforcement. But rest
assured, this president will always
stand on the side of our law enforcement
of ICE officers uh who are simply trying
to uh correct these failed policies of
Democrat officials that are making
citizens in Minnesota and all across the
country less and less safe.
Yeah, Anna, speaking of rushing to
conclusions, uh the media is doing a lot
of the work uh alongside Democrats uh
saying that this was a murder uh talking
about Renee Good as simply a mother who
was picking or dropping her child off
and then driving home. That's what I've
seen being covered by liberal media
everywhere from, you know, the usual
suspects to even People magazine trying
to portray it this way. What do you make
of the way that the media has chosen to
cover what happened in Minnesota last
week?
&gt;&gt; Well, we've seen this show before,
right? Remember when uh Kilmar Abrao
Garcia, a illegal immigrant terrorist, a
member of MS-13, uh was rightfully
deported to Secot in El Salvador and you
had Democrats uh like Chris Van Holland
rushing to El Salvador having margaritas
and their allies in the media um
supporting that, right? calling this
individual again MS-13 gang member, a
human smuggler, uh Maryland father of
the year. It's absolutely ridiculous.
And so it's again uh part of the same
destructive pattern that has led to
increased attacks on ICE, increased
attacks on law enforcement, and remember
all of these brave men and women in law
enforcements are simply uh working to
correct the failed Democrat policies
that have made Americans less safe. Uh
brought in horrific criminals, those who
killed Joselyn Nungare, Rachel Moore,
and by the way, you don't hear Democrats
uh saying those names. So the president,
the entire administration are going
going to continue to enforce our
immigration laws to make America safe
again, which is exactly what this
president was elected to do.
&gt;&gt; Anna, sticking in Minnesota, but a
different subject. The Secretary of the
Treasury, Scott Besson, was in that
state earlier in the week overseeing an
investigation into that huge burgeoning
fraud scandal that Tim Walls has
overseen. Meanwhile, the vice president
announced this new creation of a brand
new assistant attorney general position
tasked to root out fraud nationwide.
Watch.
We are creating a new assistant attorney
general position who will have
nationwide jurisdiction over the issue
of fraud. that person's efforts will
start and focus primarily in Minnesota,
but it is going to be a nationwide
effort because unfortunately the
American people have been defrauded in a
very nationwide way. So Anna, you heard
basically a summary there from the vice
president. Can you tell us anything more
about the remitt of this new role and
then when might we see an appointment to
fill it?
&gt;&gt; Sure. Well, I'll zoom out a bit because
this is something that the entire
administration uh has now been tackling
for several weeks. You have uh the
Department of Labor looking at
unemployment insurance fraud. You have
HUD looking at housing payments, SBA
looking at SBA loans. Uh so this is
something that the administration has
been looking into thankfully since
independent journalist uh Nick Shirley
really brought this issue to light. Uh
but now we're going to make sure that we
are also holding these bad actors
accountable. And so this DOJ task force
that or this DOJ office that the vice
president talked about will be purely
dedicated to this effort because we
don't want to just look into this issue
and identify criminals. We want to make
sure that we are holding these bad
actors accountable. And it's uh great
that the department of department of
justice has already brought charges
against 98 individuals. Over 60 of them
uh have been convicted. But now with
this new office in the DOJ, uh, we're
going to continue to not just look into
this issue, but make sure that these
benefits intended to serve American
citizens, uh, are going to the American
citizens they were intended and that bad
actors are no able no longer able to get
away with this massive scope of fraud
we're seeing across our country.
&gt;&gt; And do you see any timeline on an
appointment?
&gt;&gt; Well, look, of course, this is something
that the administration wants to do very
quickly. It was something that this
president has talked about very openly,
so I don't have an exact uh date for
you, but I know that this uh is going to
be in progress very soon.
&gt;&gt; Anna, it's Nicole Sapphire. I want to
quickly turn to Venezuela. The State
Department is warning Americans to leave
the country over severe security risk,
saying there are reports of armed
militias setting up roadblocks and
searching for US citizens. This comes as
President Trump warns Cuba that no oil
will be coming to the country and that
they they need to make a deal. You know,
this also is on the heels of rising
tensions in Iran. This past week, we saw
the Senate pass the War Powers
Resolution Act with the forthcoming vote
this week. What message does the
president and the White House have for
these senators, especially the
Republican senators who are voting to
restrict the president's power and how
this makes us look on the global scale?
Well, look, this president uh is willing
to do whatever it takes to secure our
homeland and protect it from uh massive
scale of drugs and criminals coming in
into our country. And that's what you
saw with the arrest of Nicholas Maduro,
who of course is a naroterrorist who is
indicted in the southern district of New
York for these naroterist charges and
for criminal conspiracy. And so I think
his message for uh bad actors around the
world is that he means what he says. He
proved that with the arrest of Nicholas
Maduro. He approved that with Operation
Midnight Hammer that totally oblit
obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities.
And so, uh, he's going to continue to do
what is necessary as commander-in-chief
and as our chief executive to protect
our homeland again, uh, as he was
elected to do. And he has been
incredibly transparent with the Hill,
uh, over the course of his actions in
Venezuela and throughout that process
and he'll continue to be so. [snorts]
&gt;&gt; And quickly, uh, on that topic, you talk
about the arrest of Nicholas Maduro. Um
there's a legal kind of justification
there that shows that to be not just a
military action. Uh when we look at
somewhere like Iran and what's happening
there, does the president feel like even
with threat from Congress using the War
Powers Act that he has all the lateral
movement he needs to, I don't know,
strike Iran's leader or do anything of
that nature as chief executive?
Well, look, I'm not going to preview any
potential options uh that the president
might be exploring, but of course, he
has a number of options uh on the table
as commander-in-chief of our United
States military, and he is uh fully
willing to use those options as
necessary, as he's demonstrated in the
past.
&gt;&gt; And lastly, the president's heading out
to Motor City this week. He's going to
speak to the Detroit Economic Club on
Tuesday. Uh kind of exciting news. Tell
us about it.
Yeah. Well, the president will be
returning to Michigan, of course, a
state that he won big uh in 2024, uh
touting all of his economic
accomplishments for Americans across
this country. Of course, this president
uh has helped cool inflation. Remember,
we had a 9% inflation rate under Joe
Biden. That is now at a 2.5 annualized
rate. He is leveraging fairer trade
deals that is going to reshore
manufacturing, especially in states like
Michigan. And so I think this president
uh is very excited to return to the uh
state of Michigan to talk about this
economic agenda and also talk about how
these economic accomplishments are going
to continue to pay dividends. Those tax
cuts when Americans file their taxes
this year. No tax on tips, no tax on
overtime, no tax on social security.
Those are things that Americans uh are
going to be feeling right in their
pockets. investments that this president
has leveraged through his fantastic
foreign policy relationships going to
reshore manufacturing in Michigan and
across the country create jobs here at
home. And so, uh, the president is very
much looking forward to this visit. Uh,
and I think you all will enjoy hearing
his economic message later this week.
&gt;&gt; I bought a lot of Ford trucks. I don't
think I've ever bought one made in the
United States. So, that would be kind of
exciting if you all could make that
happen. Anna Kelly, thank you so much
for joining us tonight. We appreciate
you.

with the Fox News alert. Anti-C protests
erupting across the US with thousands of
clashfilled demonstrations taking place
in cities like Los Angeles, Austin, and
Minneapolis as DHS releases new video
showing the minutes leading up to the
fatal shooting of Renee Good.
&gt;&gt; Our own Matt Finn is live on the ground
in cold Minneapolis with the latest on
this entire event. Matt,
&gt;&gt; hi Rachel. The protests here in
Minneapolis seem to be growing larger.
Yesterday, a massive crowd. Thousands
and thousands of people uh gathered in
Powder Horn Park in Minneapolis. That's
a notable location because that is where
former Minneapolis City Council members
announced their now failed campaign to
dismantle the police here in
Minneapolis. And that really sparked a
nationwide movement. Now, yesterday
after the demonstrations in that park,
also similarities to the George Floyd
riots in 2020, protesters marched down
Lake Street. Uh, it was a much different
scene yesterday because in 2020, many
portions of Lake Street were set on fire
during the George Floyd protests and
riots. And here are some anti-ICE
protesters.
&gt;&gt; They're not out here trying to detain
criminals. They're out here trying to
incite chaos and just it it has to be
stopped. I have always been surrounded
by and lot of immigrants and my family
and my roots. So, I'm here to stand up
for what I think is right and we as a
community are here together.
&gt;&gt; Now, Minneapolis police say well over
1,000 protesters and some riers damaged
parts of the Renaissance and Canopy
hotels downtown Friday. 29 people were
arrested, one officer injured after
being hit with a piece of ice. And
there's also new video leading up to the
the moments of Renee Good's shooting
death by an ICE agent on Wednesday.
The video appears to show Renee Good's
SUV attempting to block the street and
honking the horn. Now, border patrol
here on the ground, they tell us it is
dangerous for agents to be blocked in by
a car because there are so many anti-ICE
agitators who quickly surround them. And
Democratic Congresswoman Elon Omar along
with other House representatives say
they were denied full access to an ICE
facility here in Minneapolis yesterday.
&gt;&gt; This is just one more example of this
administration
and Christine Gnome violating the law.
This is an out of control Trump's ice.
When people are disappeared in the
darkness, American democracy dies. They
are not only disappearing people who
have committed crimes who are in this
country undocumented. They are
disappearing US citizens.
Now, DHS fired back, saying members of
Congress were notified that their visit
was improper and out of compliance with
existing court orders and policies which
mandate that members of Congress must
notify ICE at least 7 days in advance of
congressional visits. DHS also says uh
Representative Omar basically led
protests, you know, uh cheered these
protests on at the ICE facility. Back to
you guys in New York.
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Matt. Thank you, Matt.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Matt. Hey Charlie, do you and
and Griff, do you guys remember Bill
Bennett? Um he wrote a book called The
Death of Shame.
&gt;&gt; Yes, indeed.
&gt;&gt; That's what I think about when I see
Elon Omar [laughter] just showing her
face like does she know shame of
everything that's just happened in the
Somali community that she clearly knew
what was going on in that and she has
turned a blind eye. she's defended it
and here she is, you know, um talking
about all of this and getting on her
high horse and um really instigating and
and fueling so many of these riots here
in in and and protests against ICE just
trying to get rapists and murderers off
the streets. I keep wondering why who's
you say who's funding these groups? Why
don't we know more about these groups?
&gt;&gt; True. But real quick about Ilan Omar,
you know, you are right. She's not only
fueling these protests and and sometimes
it gets violent, but she's also fueling
the anti-ICE rhetoric that is causing
the ICE agents to have a 13% 100
increase in assaults on them, a 3,000
plus increase in vehicle assaults. But
but at the end of the day, you're Ilan
Omar is entitled to her opinion but not
entitled to her facts as the saying
goes. And she is saying she is spreading
this narrative that ICE is out to kill
citizens and round up and disappear US
citizens. It it's it's preposterous.
It's not true. And actually the people
she's protecting, as we just pointed out
earlier today, a illegal immigrant from
Laos was convicted of sexually
assaulting a 13-year-old child, then was
allowed to roam free in Minneapolis
because of the sanctuary city policy.
And now ICE has a duty, an obligation to
be there, and she is spreading a
narrative that is totally false.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. They also picked up a Somali uh
murder as well, an illegal immigrant
Somali murder. She didn't say anything
about that.
&gt;&gt; So if your political platform, if your
political effort right now is to defend
child rapists, which is what Ilhan Omar
and other Democrats in Minneapolis are
doing, if that's your safe space
in terms of like your political
platform, what are you running away
from? You're running away from the
biggest fraud investigation that uh that
that that we've seen in certainly in my
memory of of covering politics. uh and
and as we've spoken to uh yesterday and
today to uh our you know reported th you
know this is ju we're just looking at at
Minneapolis but this is going on all
over the country and uh earlier in the
earlier hour we talked to Dustin Greggy
who's a columnist based in Minneapolis
talking about some of these protests and
this is what he had to say.
&gt;&gt; There was a lot more energy and
ultimately a lot more flames in the
summer love. Uh right now the winter
love isn't quite kicking off to what it
used to be. And simply put, it's because
of videos like this that have recently
come out where we're seeing three and a
half minute narrative busters where DHS
and President Trump ended up being
correct from day one that this woman was
impeding on law enforcement. She knew
exactly what she was doing. She wasn't
simply a mom dropping off her kids or in
the wrong place at the wrong time. She
had been following them all day at this
point and ultimately honking her horns,
smiling and dancing to the beat of it.
Um, and ultimately, how how do we get
here? It's because of politicians like
Tim Walls who came out here, labeled
these ICE agents as Gestapo, and Peggy
Flanigan, our lieutenant governor, who
told these activists to quote unquote
put their bodies on the line.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And politicians like Tim Waltz,
but also really ungrateful immigrants
like Elon Omar. Um, she is also fueling
that. And as he's so right, as more
angles come out, the the the story from
the ICE officer gets proved over and
over again. And these guys should be
eating crow right now. But they continue
to stand by their narrative because this
is all about politics. It has nothing to
do with what's right for the city of
Minneapolis, the neighborhoods that are
being set free from having rapists and
murderers. Um, and and that that wall
was incredible that you had up. And this
may work uh in in for Minneapolis
politics for Ilhan Omar, but I can't
help but think that that broadly
speaking. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Uh nationwide, this is not does not help
Democrats.
&gt;&gt; No. And history is going to look at this
and say, ""How did as that report said,
how did we get here?"" And they're going
to look at the longer arc to realize
that one president, Joe Biden, opened up
the border and greatly put America's
public safety national security at
tremendous risk by releasing more than
12 million illegal aliens from all over
the world.

Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","Protesters for and against the Trump
administration's ICE crackdown clashed
in Minneapolis Saturday as Governor Tim
Walls prepared to mobilize his state's
National Guard troops to assist local
law enforcement as the Washington Post
is reporting the Pentagon is preparing
active duty soldiers for a possible
deployment to Minnesota. In a moment,
we're going to bring in Deputy Attorney
General Todd Blanch. But first, Fox News
correspondent Matt Finn is in
Minneapolis. Matt
&gt;&gt; and Shannon. The Washington Post reports
about 1,500 active duty soldiers are
prepared to possibly head here to
Minnesota if the violence escalates. And
yesterday it was another day of some
pretty intense clashes.
Unrest showing no signs of slowing down
in the Twin Cities. Persistent
protesters even lit fires for warmth on
a snowy Friday night outside of the ICE
detention center. Hours earlier, inside
US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanch,
telling immigration agents the DOJ will
go after anyone who lays a finger on
them.
&gt;&gt; My marching orders from President Trump
all the way on down, Attorney General
Bondi all the way on down, is that every
single time that happens, we will
prosecute.
&gt;&gt; In a special state address this week,
Governor Walls telling people to collect
evidence against ICE. All across
Minnesota, people are learning about
opportunities not just to resist, but to
help people who are in danger.
&gt;&gt; The DOJ is now investigating Walls and
Fry for possibly impeding immigration
enforcement. Mayor Fry says the probe is
meant to intimidate him. Governor Walls,
writing, ""The only person not being
investigated for the shooting of Renee
Good is the federal agent who shot her.""
outraged Democrats alleged DHS agents
are racially profiling and violating
civil rights.
&gt;&gt; For the moment, we can certainly block
giving additional funding to ICE and
CBP.
&gt;&gt; And Shannon, here in Minnesota, anti-ICE
activists have scheduled a statewide day
of action for this Friday. They're
asking people not to go to work, not to
go to school, and not to make purchases.
Shannon.
&gt;&gt; All right, Matt Finn reporting from
Minneapolis. Matt, thank you to you and
your team there on the ground. And
joining us now, Deputy Attorney General
Todd Blanch. Thanks for your time this
morning.
&gt;&gt; Good morning.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's start here. I want to
play a little bit more of what
Congresswoman Jipal had to say uh about
what she says is actually happening on
the ground there in Minneapolis.
We are seeing horrifying videos of ICE
agents battering down people's doors
without a warrant, racially profiling
people on the street, busting in car
windows, and trying to intimidate and
suppress the First Amendment rights to
peacefully protest.
&gt;&gt; So my question is, is she inaccurate the
way she's mischaracterizing or is she
mischaracterizing what's happening
there? Or is that actually happening?
But the argument is ICE has the
authority to do what they're doing.
Yeah, what what what you just heard was
a complete lie. That is absolutely not
is what's happening on the ground in
Minnesota. I was there on Friday. I saw
what the men and women of ICE are doing
every day and they are doing their job.
And and there are folks that may not
like that they're doing their job, but
these these blatant accusations that
they're violating the the First
Amendment or somehow committing crimes
are not only completely false, but
they're doing real damage to our law
enforcement officers around the country.
And it's interesting that there are
thousands of immigration actions all
over this country every single day and
nowhere do you hear this outrage this
this madeup outrage from local
politicians and activists except for in
Minnesota and and that should be telling
to the American people.
&gt;&gt; So they have you know those who are
protesting and supporting the protesters
took this to court. A federal judge on
Friday late ruled that there are a
number of things agents cannot do. Now,
part of what she said is they can't use
pepper spray or similar non-lethal
munitions on these crowds. She does
reference them being engaged in peaceful
and unobstructive protest activity. She
also says you can't stop stop or detain
drivers or passengers in vehicles where
there's no reasonable articulable
suspicion that they're actually
obstructing or interfering. She goes on
to say, you know, if they're following
and tagging and filming ICE, that is not
something that is a stoppable uh issue.
So, how does this impact operations
there? and are you going to appeal that
decision?
&gt;&gt; We're still looking at whether to appeal
what that judge did at this point. But
I'll tell you, it's absurd for the the
the media and and some of these
politicians to call what these folks are
doing as peaceful protests. They're
throwing rocks at ICE officers. They are
standing in the roadway where they try
to drive by. They're putting their
vehicles in the roadway while they try
to drive by. So if a judge tells ICE
officers not to vi violate the
constitutional rights of protesters, we
got it. We're not violating the
constitutional rights. But what should
be happening instead of going after ICE
officers, what should be happening is
local leaders should be sending law
enforcement out to stop the protesters
from assaulting ICE officers for doing
nothing except for their job. And that's
that's the real issue here is you have
you have men and women who have families
going out and doing exactly what they're
supposed to do and being screamed at,
pushed, assaulted, having rocks thrown
at them. We will not tolerate that and
that that's that's been our position
from the beginning and it will remain
our position for the rest of this
administration.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So Friday we also learned that the
DOJ is reportedly investigating Governor
Walls, uh, Mayor Fry there. Um, they
have both responded. Here's what we
heard from the mayor on Friday. He said,
""It's an obvious attempt to intimidate
me for standing up for Minneapolis, our
local law enforcement, and our residents
against the chaos and danger this
administration has brought to our
streets."" He says, ""I will not be
intimidated."" What can you tell us about
the investigation and the perception or
accusation that you all are weaponizing
law enforcement against these folks?
You saw the governor and the mayor
actively encouraging encouraging
criminals to go out on the street and
impede ICE. That is not allowed under
our law. When a federal officer is out
doing their job, they have to be allowed
to do their jobs. And the fact that we
had to stand up and tell a mayor that we
had to stand up and tell a governor to
stop encouraging the folks that are that
are out there running around trying to
stop ICE to stop encouraging them when
what they really should be doing is
helping their fellow federal officers is
something that's that's horrible. But
listen, no matter who you are, whether
you're a governor, a mayor, or or
somebody out there on the streets
assaulting ICE, you cannot under federal
law, you cannot impede a federal officer
doing their job. And that that's that's
what we're looking at. And and I'm not
going to talk about the investigation,
but but American people can can see what
the mayor has been saying. They can see
what the governor's been saying, and
it's obvious that that has to stop.
&gt;&gt; Well, the governor's response referenced
a number of things. um you know going
after Mark Kelly, he says Alyssa
Slackin, Jerome Powell, but he also
mentioned what Matt Finn uh mentioned in
his reporting there. He says the only
person not being investigated for the
shooting of Renee Good is the federal
agent who shot her. So is the FBI con
conducting investigation into that agent
into the shooting? What can you tell us
about that? Will it be made public?
Look, what happened on that day has been
reviewed by millions and millions of
Americans because it was recorded on on
phones um when it happened. Okay? The
civil rights, the Department of Justice,
our civil rights unit, we don't just go
out and investigate every time an
officer is is is forced to defend
himself against somebody or putting his
life in danger. We never do. That has
nothing to do with what happened in
Minne Minneapolis. There are over a
thousand shootings every year where law
enforcement are put in danger by
individuals and they have to protect
themselves and they have a lawful right
to do so. The Department of Justice just
doesn't just stand up and investigate
because some congressman thinks we
should, because some governor thinks
that we should. We investigate when it's
appropriate to investigate. And that is
not the case here. It wasn't the case
when it happened and it's not the case
today. If circumstances change and
there's something that we do need to
investigate around that shooting or any
other shooting, we will. But but we are
not going to bow to pressure from the
media, bout of pressure from politicians
and do something that we never do. Not
under this administration, not under the
last administration. And so, no, we we
are not investigating. And if if if
there comes a time when we need to, we
will. But it's not now.
&gt;&gt; Is there some type of internal review
though that happens when someone dies at
the hands of an agent? Of
course. I mean, every law enforcement
agency has has their own protocols when
an officer is required to defend
themselves. Every single law enforcement
agency, even the Minnesota Police
Department in Minneapolis, and so does
DHS, and so does the FBI, and so does
every state police department. And so,
of course, there's an investigation
that's happening, but that's a big
difference from what you have the
governor insisting that this civil
rights unit do and this Department of
Justice do. And and we are not going to
do that. Okay, let's talk about the
insurrection act. Uh the president
sounds like I mean he's talked about it
possibly being used in a number of
situations and specifically there in
Minnesota. It sounds like he's standing
down or at least saying he doesn't think
it's necessary at this point, but we've
got the Washington Post reporting that
some 1500 active duty troops, the
Pentagon's put them on standby
potentially to deploy into this
situation. Um no surprise that the
attorney general there in Minnesota,
Keith Ellison, has said he'll go
straight to court over this if you
decide to sue. Um he also has already
filed a separate uh lawsuit saying this.
He says the threat suggests that the
federal government is attempting to
create a pretext for military deployment
by provoking civil unrest. Your
response?
&gt;&gt; Well, President Trump has promised to
keep the American people safe and the
fact that the local law enforcement
because their leadership is not doing
their jobs. There may come a time when
the president has to order that. And we
support him. the attorney general
supports him because we have to keep the
citizens safe. Now, in cities across
this country, in all 50 states, that's
done by local law enforcement and
leadership. Unfortunately, in
Minneapolis, those local law
enforcement, who I'm sure are great men
and women are being ordered to stand
down. And so, when the American people,
when the the citizens of Minnesota are
threatened by what's happening there,
you better believe President Trump's
going to be there for them. He promised,
he campaigned on that. He won the
election on that. and and if he sees
what's happening continue, that's that's
an available tool to make sure that that
American citizens stay safe.
&gt;&gt; All right, just to clarify a couple of
things. You say local law enforcement's
being told to stand down. Is that in in
response to attacks on ICE, these
situations? You're saying the locals are
not showing up. They're not controlling
the situation.
&gt;&gt; Local leadership told citizens to call
911 when they see ICE. They did not tell
lo did they did not tell citizens to
call 911 when they see ICE officers
being assaulted and attacked. And to the
contrary, police officers are not
anywhere to be seen around the ICE
facilities. When the ICE officers are
out doing the work they have to do,
there are no cops around. And that is
not that is not the way that it that it
takes place in cities across this
country. In virtually every place we go
in, we get support from law enforcement
because that's their job. And again,
this is not an indictment of the of the
men and women who are police officers in
that city. This is an indictment of the
leadership that's telling them what to
do. And that's why President Trump is
looking at all available options and
will continue to do so because the local
leadership is not letting local law
enforcement do their jobs.

Blanch, thanks for your time today.

FORMER SECRET SERVICE SPECIAL
AGENT CHARLES MORENO.
YOU HAD A CHURCH DISRUPTION,
MANY SEE THAT AS A BRIDGE TOO
FAR.
A VIRAL VIDEO SHOWS AN ICE AGENT
SPEAKING TO THE CAMERA AS
PROTESTERS WERE HONKING SAYING,
WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW, YOU ARE
SUPPORTING A CHILD SEX PREDATOR
WHO WE ARE TRYING TO ARREST.
THAT VIDEO IS GOING VIRAL.
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THESE TWO
INCIDENTS AS PROTESTS ARE RAGING
ON IN MINNEAPOLIS.
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, THERE HAS BEEN
A LOTZ OF RED LINES CROSSED BY
THE GOVERNOR AND MAYOR OF
MINNEAPOLIS.
AS WELL AS PROTEST GROUPS, SOME
ORIGINATING FROM THE LOCAL AREA.
MANY PROTEST GROUPS WILL
CONTINUE TO ORIGINATE FROM
OUTSIDE THE AREA AND REGION AS
THEY BECOME MORE ORGANIZE SAID
AND MORE DISRUPTIVE.
IT IS POSITION OF DEMOCRATS AND
SANCTUARY CITIES IS NOT GOING TO
CHANGE ANY TIME SOON.
THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
PLAY A ROLE IN INSIGHTING AND
OBSTRUCTING WHEN IT COMES TO
ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL
IMMIGRATION LAWS AND CONTINUE TO
VILLAINIZE ICE EVERY OPPORTUNITY
THEY GET.
THIS CAN BE SIMPLER IN
MINNEAPOLIS IF THEY
COLLABORATIVELY WORKED WITH ICE,
ALLOWED THEM INTO JAIL AND ALLOW
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO WORK
WITH THEM.
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THEY
CHOOSE TO DO, THEY CHOOSE TO
GIVE UNREALISTIC ULTMATZUM TO IT
IS FDZ GOVERNMENT SAYING IN
ORDER FOR THINGS TO BE PEACEFUL
ICE NEED TO LEAVE AND THAT WILL
NEVER HAPPEN.
&gt;&gt; Todd: IN LIGHT OF WHAT YOU
JUST SAID, WE HAVE FEDERAL
TROOPS ATSZ THE READY SHOULD
DONALD TRUMP SEND IN TROOPS TO
MINNESOTA.
&gt;&gt; I WAS ON RECORD HERE THE
OTHER DAY WITH ""FOX AND FRIENDS""
SAYING ABSOLUTELY.
THE CONDITIONS EXIST ON THE
GROUND.
IT IS PTZ HAS CLEAR AUTHORITY
AND THE INSURRECTION ACT SHOULD
BE INVOKED.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND DANGEROUS
FOR ICE AND CBP TO EXECUTE
STATUTORY AUTHORITY WITHIN
MINNEAPOLIS AND SOME POINT IN
TIME, THE COURTS NEED TO PLAY A
ROLE HERE.
THEY HAVE BOXED IT IS PTZ IN AND
SAID WHILE HE IS ALLOWED TO
FEDERALIZE IT IS NATIONAL, HE IS
NOTSZ ALLOWED TO DEPLOY THEM.
YOU SEE 1500 FULL-TIME MILITARY
READY TO COME IN.
&gt;&gt; Carley: THE PTZ PUT 1500
SOLDIERS ON STAND AND GOVERNOR
MRASZED NATIONAL GUARD ON
POTENTIAL STAND.
IF BOTH GROUPS ARE DEPLOYED, WHO
WILL DEFEND WHAT IS  AND WHAT
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE?
&gt;&gt; IF THE PRESIDENT DECLARES
INSURRECTION ACT IN EFFECT HE
TAKES CONTROL OF FULL-TIME
MILITARY AND NATIONAL GUARD.
WE WOULD NOTSZ HAVE A SCENARIO
WHICH WE'VE HEARD MAYOR FREY
TALK ABOUT, WHERE WE'D HAVE A
SITUATION OF STATE AND LOCAL
FIGHTING WITH ICE AGENTS.
YOU WILL NOT SEE STATES AND
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLLOW
THAT TYPE OF GUIDANCE.
WHEN IT COMES TO MILITARY,
FULL-TIME MILITARY IS NOW GOING
UP AGAINST NATIONAL GUARD
BECAUSE ONE WAS ACT VATSZED BY
THE LOCAL AS OPPOSE SAID TO
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
&gt;&gt; Todd: ""NEW YORK POST""
REPORTING SOCIALISTS GROUP HERE
HAS PLANS TO ROUND UP A RAPID
RESPONSE TEAM.
THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL PROTEST
ICE AND DO MORE THAN PROTEST, AS
THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS.
IF THEY OBSTRUCT, DO YOU THINK
DOJ NEED TO PROSECUTE EVERY ONE
OF THEM TO SEND A MESSAGE AND
GET THIS OBSTRUCTION TO STOP?
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO SAY, THE RED LINES
HAVE BEEN CROSSED, ESPECIALLY IN
MINNESOTA.
I BELIEVE INVESTIGATION SHOULD
BE UNDERWAY WITH RESPECT TO
OBSTRUCTION, INSIGHTSMENT AND
THREATS AGAINST FEDERAL AGENTS.
THOSE CHARGES SHOULD BE EXPLORED
IN OTHER SANCTUARY LOCATIONS AS
ICE CONTINUES TO CARRY OUT THEIR
MISSION.
LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL HAVE TO PAY
CLOSE ATTENTION TO INTELLIGENCE
HERE REGARDING THESE GROUPS,
MANY RADICAL AND MANY ALIGNED
WITH GROUPS LIKE ANTIFA AND
OTHERS THAT WANT TO COME AND GET
VIOLENT AND MIX IT UP WITH
FEDERAL AGENTS.
IT IS THE NARRATIVE OF DEMOCRATS
THAT IT IS ICE'S FAULT, ICE
SHOULD BE VILLAINIZE SAID AND
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ATZ FAULT AND
THAT IS FALSE AND I DON'T THINK
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE
AMERICAN PUBLIC BUY INTO THAT
NONSENSE.
&gt;&gt; Todd: IT IS NATION WATCHING"

Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","Joining us now with some answers to the
questions that a lot of you have, ICE
director Todd Lions. Todd, thank you for
being back.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Peter. Good seeing you.
&gt;&gt; So, let's start in Portland where the
police chief was crying while admitting
that two illegal immigrants who were
shot by ICE this week have ties to Trend
Ara, TDA.
It saddens me that we even have to
qualify um these remarks
because I understand or at least have
attempted to understand through your
voices your concern, your fear, your
anger.
&gt;&gt; Director Lions, what's he crying about?
&gt;&gt; You know, [clears throat] Peter, I I
have no idea what he's crying about. you
know, border patrol agents were
conducting a targeted enforcement
operation on suspected TDA gang members
in a human trafficking prostitute and
staying in his city. So, I would think
he would be happy that we take these
criminal elements out of his
neighborhoods, but I'm not sure what
he's crying about. Uh, he went on to say
that he didn't want to victim blame.
There's there were criminals in this
situation, not victims. And if you use a
3 to 4,000lb vehicle to attempt to ram a
law enforcement officer, whether it's
one of his officers, state police, or
border patrol agent, there's going to be
consequences. And we're happy that we're
taking two TDA gang members, which TDA
is a known suspected terrorist
organization now, out of the community.
And moving on to Minneapolis, there's
this video that most people watching and
have seen, but we are going to put it up
on the screen. It's the officer's point
of view taken by an iPhone. He's got an
iPhone in one hand and a gun in the
other hand. Why no body cam?
So, we're still in the process of
deploying body cameras for all law
enforcement officers. Unfortunately, in
the last administration, we didn't have
the funding. Only our special response
team had that. But the officer made that
decision, his team, that they were going
to arrest agitators that day. That's why
he was recording. You know, as you can
see in that video, he was documenting
the license plate, documenting the area,
and he wasn't standing in front of that
vehicle. he was going around to the
driver's door where the other officer
was attempting to make that arrest when
unfortunately that incident happened.
So, you know, a split-second decision on
his part. You know, he had a driver's
weapon while he was still filming um and
his training kicked in. But again, if
you if a civilian puts himself in this
situation and you get involved in a law
enforcement operation, it's just not
smart and tragedies happen.
&gt;&gt; There is some new math coming out of
Minneapolis this weekend courtesy of the
mayor, Jacob Fry.
50% of the shootings that have happened
thus far in Minneapolis this year have
been ICE. In other words, we've only had
two shootings.
One of them has been ICE.
We are a safe city. ICE is making it
less so. We are a city of unity, but ICE
is trying to divide us and tear us
apart.
&gt;&gt; Director Lions, it's a small sample
size, but what do you say about that?
Mayor Frey saying half the shootings are
you guys.
&gt;&gt; You know, uh to me that's just again
that this heated political rhetoric that
just doesn't need to be. Um you know, no
law enforcement officer wants to be
involved in any type of deadly force
situation. And like I've always said
since the beginning of this, you know,
our hearts and minds and prayers go out
to all that were involved in the
situation. But to categorically,
you know, say that more than half of the
shootings are now because of us, that's
ridiculous. And to your point about the
rhetoric, lawmakers in Washington never
like to let a good crisis go to waste.
There have been a lot of hot takes in
the last couple days like this one.
&gt;&gt; I understand that Vice President Vance
believes that shooting a young mother of
three in the face three times is an
acceptable America that he wants to live
in. And I do not. And that is a
fundamental difference uh between Vice
President Vance and I. I do not believe
that the American people um should be
assassinated in the street. A lot of
Democrats say that they think that is
what happened, that this woman was
assassinated in the street. What do you
say to them?
&gt;&gt; So, what I just say to them is obviously
look at the video, look at the
situation. Um, it wasn't an
assassination. That law enforcement
officer had milliseconds, if not short
time, to make a decision to save his
life and his other fellow agents. So, it
wasn't an assassination. And again, you
know, I think a lot of the political
rhetoric is where we're at right now in
the first place. There's just so much
attacks on ICE, you know, and
unfortunately it does come from a lot of
elected officials. We would much rather
work with elected officials to hold
individuals accountable that are doxing
agents, threatening agents, etc. But
instead for, you know, elected officials
to call upon the impeachment of ICE to
resist ICE, that just only stokes these
fires and gets these individuals who who
aren't, you know, trying to do the right
thing when it comes to ICE, gets them
fired up more. And Democrats keep
claiming that your officers are
terrorizing their cities. In
Minneapolis, a city council member is
actually saying now city leadership is
exploring every possible avenue to end
ICE activity in Minneapolis. Can they do
that?
No, Peter, they can't. And you know,
everyone keeps saying about ICE out of
Minnesota. That ICE has been in
Minnesota since the inception of DHS and
even before that under DOJ with when we
were INS. So, we've always been
conducting immigration enforcement in
all 50 states, but I always go back to
say we wouldn't be out on the street if
local jurisdictions worked with us to
turn over these crimally illegal aliens
once they are already considered a
public safety threat by the locals. Just
turn them over to us in a safe, secure
environment. And you wouldn't have to
have us going out and arresting these
folks. But, you know, we did just
release that list of the worst of the
worst that we arrested. You know, we
arrested someone that fled the state of
Connecticut on a warrant for a rape of a
child to hide in plain sight in
Minneapolis. And he was also wanted for
murder in his home country. So, I would
think people would be happy and excited
that those are the individuals were
taken off the streets. I don't know why
anybody in their right mind would
champion that type of individual. And
before we let you go, Director Lions, I
talked to President Trump this week
about an alleged organized crime
conspiracy to hurt ICE officers.
What has your team told you about this
broad left-wing network? Who is in
charge of it? Who's part of it? What
what's it called?
&gt;&gt; Well, I haven't seen the vice
president's statement, but he's
generally very accurate. I hate to say
it. Uh, look, uh, I watched that
yesterday, and there are a lot of lot of
different forms to it, but there was a
woman screaming shame, shame, shame,
shame. She was a agitator, probably a
paid agitator, but in my opinion, she
was an agitator. a very high level
agitator.
&gt;&gt; Director Lions, what have you been told
about this left-wing network the White
House is talking about that is
threatening ICE officers nationwide?
&gt;&gt; Well, Peter, ICE, uh, you know, Homeland
Security Investigations and the FBI,
we're actively investigating many groups
all across the US now that are actively
targeting ICE officers and agents and
other federal partners in their
day-to-day mission. So, we do believe
there's a c criminal conspiracy going
on. We are working with all of our
federal partners to try to track down
the funding, the leadership of these
groups because you know we would see
time and time again ICE officers and
agents would be doing an operation and
within seconds to minutes all of a
sudden there's 50 60 protesters on that
site. So there's an active active group
out there that is criminally based
that's you know impeding and causing
these operations in.
&gt;&gt; All right, Director Todd Lions, thank
you very much for being here.
&gt;&gt; Great seeing you Peter. Thank you.

This breaking just as we come on the air
tonight, we have learned that there was
an ICE involved shooting in Minneapolis.
Uh we go live to Alexis McAdams. She is
live on the ground with the details. Uh
Alexis, I' I've just been looking at
these images that we're just getting a
hold of now and we'll keep them up for
our audience to see. It looks like
things are, you know, spiraling out of
control very quickly there.
&gt;&gt; Well, Sean, that's the thing is it es
and flows. So, one minute, you know,
there's a small protest at the federal
building. The next minute, these people
with whistles and an agenda show up to
these different sites across the city.
That's what DHS has been saying. What we
know right now from our colleague Bill
Malusian, who just got off the phone
with this federal sources, Sean, is that
a man who was a target of an ICE
operation from Venezuela, who ICE says
was in the country illegally, was a
target in this operation here in
Minnesota. So, they go to the door.
That's when they say this Venezuelan
migrant held up a shovel, tried to
assault one of their agents. And you can
hear those chants there in the
background as protesters show up. That's
when they say used the shovel to try and
assault the agent. Shots were fired.
This Venezuelan teen, we're told, was
shot in the lake, expected to be okay.
Bill Malusian telling me there's
actually a picture that a source texted
him of this guy on a stretcher smiling,
kind of giving a thumbs up as he's taken
away to the hospital. So, we'll get more
on what's going on there at the scene.
But, it's become aggressive here and I
saw it today when I was on the ground
with law enforcement here with ICE
agents here in Minnesota. It's something
we've been keeping an eye on as it
continues to grow. But it comes as the
governor here, Tim Walls, who's also
under investigation in this huge fraud
scheme here, Sean, just told people,
""Hey, these are just our neighbors. And
if you see them getting arrested, take
out your cell phone and record. Watch.""
&gt;&gt; Armed, masked, undertrained ICE agents
are going door to door ordering people
to point out where their neighbors of
color live. They're pulling over people
indiscriminately,
including US citizens, and demanding to
see their papers. And if you see these
ICE agents in your neighborhood, take
out that phone and hit record. Help us
create a database of the atrocities
against motans.
&gt;&gt; But that's just not what we saw today on
the streets of Minneapolis. You can see
the protesters are continuing to erupt
here with anger. But when you talk to
ICE agents, they say that they're being
doxed, they're being tracked, and
they're being targeted here. We saw it
when before they even got out of the car
today at some of these crime scenes.
These people were out notifying law
enforcement. Take a look at this.
&gt;&gt; And then also, we can tell you that the
tactic though is not new here in the
streets of Minneapolis. It's been
rampant. Borders are Tom Hman telling
Fox earlier the White House is actually
looking into who these protesters you
see on your screen are. Uh you can see
the pepper balls. You can see the pepper
spray being shot and this is what
continues to happen. Sean, uh you know,
we can tell you it's been a week since
Renee Nicole Good was shot here in the
streets of Minneapolis. But ICE says
they're not pulling out. This is
targeted operation.
&gt;&gt; Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here

most compelling analysis. You will not
get it anywhere else."

THANK YOU SO MUCH.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; Dana: WE ARE BRINGING TO YOU
A TASTE OF THIS TEACHERS UNION
PRESS CONFERENCE BEING HELD IN
MINNEAPOLIS RIGHT NOW.
THEY CLOSED SCHOOL YESTERDAY AND
TODAY.
THEY'VE DECLARED TODAY A DAY OF
UNITY.
THE WOMAN WHO SPOKE JUST SAID
EVERY MINNESOTAN IS AT RISK OF
WHAT HAPPENED TO RACHEL GOOD.
SEEMS LIKE A LITTLE FARFETCHED.
&gt;&gt; MOMENT OF SILENCE COMING UP
AT 10:00 A.M. CENTRAL TIME.
LAST NIGHT AT THE TIMBERWOLVES
SOLD OUT ARENA IN MINNEAPOLIS
HAD A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOLLOWED
BY A COUPLE OF CHOICE LINES FOR
ICE AND OTHER FEDERAL EMPLOYEES
WORKING IN THEIR STATE.
TRICIA MCLAUGHLIN DHS ASSISTANT
SECRETARY.
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON TODAY.
FIRST REACTION TO WHAT THE
TEACHERS ARE SAYING.
WHEN THEY WANT ALL THESE SCHOOLS
TO BE IN A SAFE ZONE
ESSENTIALLY.
&gt;&gt; THAT CERTAINLY DID NOT SEEM
VERY UNIFYING OR THOSE
INDIVIDUALS SPEAKING HAD THE
FACTS ON THE GROUND.
SECRETARY NOEM WAS JUST THERE IN
MINNEAPOLIS, AS YOU BOTH KNOW,
AND WHAT WE SAW AS FAR AS
ARRESTS GO WAS THEY WERE
ARRESTING MULTIPLE CHILD
PEDOPHILES.
I HAVE SEEN THE REPORTS OF WHO
THEY'VE PICKED UP, SCORES AND
SCORES OF CHILD PEDOPHILES.
THESE EDUCATORS SHOULD REALLY BE
THANKING ICE.
AS FAR AS GOING ON THE GROUND,
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT GO
INTO SCHOOLS UNLESS THERE IS A
PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT WITHIN
THOSE SCHOOLS.
WHAT WE SAW ON WEDNESDAY WITH
ONE OF THOSE EDUCATORS WAS
REFERRING TO, THERE WAS AN
INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS ASSAULTING
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HE START
EVIDENCE A CHASE THAT WENT ABOUT
FIVE MILES.
THIS SUBJECT OF THIS CHASE
STARTED GOING OVER BARRIERS.
HE WAS RUNNING RED LIGHTS AND
EVENTUALLY HE TOOK THE CHASE
ONTO SCHOOL GROUNDS.
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT DID NOT GO
INTO THE SCHOOL AND MADE SURE TO
DIFFUSE THE SITUATION.
IT WAS THIS SUBJECT, THIS
INDIVIDUAL WHO PUT CHILDREN AT
RISK.
IT IS OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SECRETARY
NOEM WHO ARE ACTUALLY PROTECTING
THESE CHILDREN ON THE GROUND IN
MINNEAPOLIS.
UNFORTUNATELY WE SEE TIM WALZ
AND A LOT OF POLITICIANS TURNING
A BLIND EYE TO THE VICTIMS OF
THESE CRIMES, TO THE CHILDREN
WHO HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED AND
ABUSED.
AND TO ALSO OTHER VICTIMS OF
MURDER.
WE HAD PICKED UP A KNOWN OR
SUSPECTED TERRORIST.
MULTIPLE GANG MEMBERS IN THE
LAST FIVE WEEKS WE'VE BEEN IN
MINNEAPOLIS.
&gt;&gt; Dana: YOU MENTIONED GOVERNOR
WALZ.
HE WAS TALKING LAST NIGHT ABOUT
MINNESOTA BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE
INVESTIGATION.
WATCH HERE.
&gt;&gt; IT FEELS NOW THAT MINNESOTA
HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE
INVESTIGATION.
IT FEELS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT
THAT WE WILL GET A FAIR OUTCOME.
WHEN KRISTI NOEM WAS JUDGE, JURY
AND EXECUTIONER YESTERDAY.
IT'S DIFFICULT TO THINK THEY
WILL BE FAIR.
WITH THAT BEING SAID,
MINNESOTANS, WE'VE RISEN TO THE
OCCASION SO FAR.
IT WILL GET CHALLENGING.
&gt;&gt; Dana: HAS MINNESOTA BEEN
TAKEN OUT?
&gt;&gt; SLIGHT NOT.
HOW HE FEELS INSTEAD OF WHAT THE
FACTS ARE ON THE GROUND.
D.O.J. TALK ABOUT THE
INVESTIGATION ITSELF BUT HIS
INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC IS NOT
HELPING PUBLIC SAFETY IN
MINNESOTA.
I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE
TALK ABOUT THE FACTS THAT
HAPPENED THAT DAY ESPECIALLY
WHEN LETHAL FORCE WAS USED.
THIS INDIVIDUAL, THE SUBJECT IN
QUESTION, DECEASED, HAD BEEN
FOLLOWING OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT
THROUGHOUT THE DAY STALKING
THEM.
AT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT OUR
LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS OUTSIDE OF
THEIR VEHICLE TRYING TO GET
THEIR VEHICLE OUT OF THE SNOW.
WHEN SHE STARTED BLOCKING OUR
LAW ENFORCEMENT HARASSING THEM,
IMPEDING LAWFUL OPERATIONS ON
THE GROUND.
THAT'S WHEN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT
APPROACHED THE INDIVIDUAL, TOLD
HER TO EXIT THE CAR AND STOP
IMPEDING LAW ENFORCEMENT.
SHE WOULD NOT OBEY THE LAWFUL
COMMANDS AND THAT'S WHEN SHE PUT
HER FOOT ON THE GAS AND
UNFORTUNATELY OUR LAW
ENFORCEMENT FOLLOWED HIS
TRAINING BUT HE DID FIRE
DEFENSIVE SHOTS.
WE'RE GLAD HE IS SAFE.
BUT WITH ANY LOSS OF LIFE OF
COURSE WE PRAY FOR THE DECEASED
AND HER FAMILY AND OUR LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND EVERYONE
INVOLVED.
&gt;&gt; Bill: WHAT APPEARS TO BE
HAPPENING IS BOTH SIDES ARE
LINING UP TO DEFEND THEIR
ARGUMENTS AND WE'RE SEEING THIS
FROM THE TEACHERS UNION THERE IN
MINNESOTA.
HERE IS CONGRESSWOMAN JAYAPAL
SAID THIS.
&gt;&gt; THE TRUTH IS EVERY SINGLE
PERSON IN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, U.S. CITIZENS, WHITE,
BLACK, BROWN, WHOEVER YOU ARE,
YOU HAVE TO WORRY NOW THAT AN
ICE AGENT IS GOING TO COME AND
SHOOT AT YOU AND KILL YOU.
&gt;&gt; Bill: I WANT YOU TO REACT TO
THAT AND ALSO THE NUMBERS WE ARE
GETTING FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT.
THIS IS FROM DHS.
NUMBER ASSAULTS UP 1300%.
VEHICLE ATTACKS UP 3200% AND
DEATH THREATS UP 8,000.
&gt;&gt; IT'S WORDS LIKE THAT
INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC LIKE THAT
FROM THAT SITTING CONGRESSWOMAN
WHY WE'RE SEEING A COORDINATED
CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AGAINST LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
YOU POINTED TO THOSE STATISTICS
AS WELL AS VEHICLE RAMINGS ARE
UP 32 HUNDRED HUNDRED%.
WE'VE SEEN TEN IN THE LAST 48
HOURS ALONE.
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS FOR LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
WE HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND
SAY WHY ARE WE IN MINNEAPOLIS
AND IN THESE CITIES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY?
IT IS BECAUSE SANCTUARY CITIES
LIKE MINNEAPOLIS WILL NOT LET US
IN THEIR JAILS.
SO THEY WILL HAVE KNOWN OR
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS, CHILD
PEDOPHILES, VIOLENT PUBLIC
SAFETY THREATS AND JUST RELEASE
THEM BACK ONTO THE STREETS.
IN THIS YEAR ALONE, GOVERNOR
WALZ AND HIS TEAM HAVE RELEASED
OVER 500 PUBLIC SAFETY THREATS
WHO ARE CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS
BACK TO THE STREETS OF MINNESOTA
AND WHY WE NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT
ON THE GROUND TO MAKE SURE THE
CRIMES ARE NOT PERPETUATED,
ARREST THE INDIVIDUALS AND MAKE
SURE THE CITIZENS OF MINNESOTA
BECAUSE THEIR POLITICIANS REFUSE
TO DO IT.
&gt;&gt; Dana: I WOKE TO THE NEWS
ABOUT AN INCIDENT IN PORTLAND
REGARDING THE BORDER PATROL.
CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT HAPPENED
THERE?
WE UNDERSTAND SOMEBODY WAS SHOT.
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A TARGETED TRAFFIC
ENFORCEMENT STOP.
THE TARGET OF THE TRAFFIC STOP
WAS A FEMALE.
32.
SHE IS AN AFFILIATE OF TREN DE
ARAGUA AND INVOLVED IN A
PROSTITUTION RING AS MANY OF
YOUR VIEWERS ARE FAMILIAR, TREN
DE ARAGUA IS OUT OF VENEZUELA
ENRICHING THEMSELVES THROUGH
DRUG TRAFFICKING AND THE
TRAFFICKING OF YOUNG WOMAN.
SHE WAS THE PASSENGER OF THE
VEHICLE AS WELL OF THE DRIVER OF
THE VEHICLE.
WE BELIEVE HE IS A MEMBER OF
TREN DE ARAGUA.
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS PULLED
THEM OVER.
AS THEY WERE APPROACHING THE
VEHICLE, WHEN THEY REALIZED --
WHEN THE SUBJECTS REALIZED WHO
LAW ENFORCEMENT WERE THEY PULLED
FORWARD ATTEMPTING TO HIT OUR
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT'S WHEN
OUR AGENT AGAIN FOLLOWED HIS
TRAINING AND FIRED DEFENSIVE
SHOTS AT THE VEHICLE AND THE
SUBJECTS DROVE FIVE MILES AND
PROCEEDED TO CALL 911 AND NOW IN
THE HOSPITAL.
OUR AGENT PRACTICED AND FOLLOWED
HIS TRAINING AS HE SHOULD HAVE.
&gt;&gt; Bill: IN THE HOSPITAL AND
PRESUMABLY UNDER ARREST AS WELL
AT THIS POINT.
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY."

over the shooting of a Minnesota woman
by an ICE officer. As DHS Secretary
Gnome defends her domestic terrorism
assessment,
&gt;&gt; if you look at what the definition of
domestic terrorism is, it completely
fits this individual. As you saw in the
video that we released just 48 hours
after this incident, uh showed that this
officer was hit by her vehicle. She
weaponized it and he defended his life
and those colleagues around him.
So DHS saying new video of the moments
beforehand proves Renee Good was quote
stalking and impeding a law enforcement
operation all morning as additional
video shows how it went down from the
officer's point of view. Watch.
&gt;&gt; You want to come at us? You want to come
at us? I say go get yourself some lunch,
big boy. Go ahead.
Get out of the car. Get out OF THE CAR.
FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST Greg Jared joins
us now. So Greg, uh, weigh in here. I I
saw on the Sunday shows, they really
took this on about the the Secretary of
Homeland Security's words and that quote
domestic terrorism. This is actually a
legal term that has been debated for
years. What is your view on the
situation here?
&gt;&gt; Well, Lawrence, domestic terrorism is
actually defined as violence by
individuals or groups driven by extreme
political ideologies to try to affect
government conduct through coercion,
criminal acts, and you know, a vehicle
is a deadly weapon. And if you weaponize
it to harm a federal officer, if you're
doing it uh because you politically
disagree with ICE enforcing the law,
then sure. I mean, it could be described
as domestic terrorism. Look at the
database. It's filled with cases
involving vehicles as domestic
terrorism. And you know, in the end,
there's really no excuse under the law
for resisting or fleeing law enforcement
and accelerating your SUV with an
officer either of in front of it or
perpendicular that puts him in harm's
way, triggering the law of self-defense.
And the legal test is whether this
officer at that moment reasonably
believed his life was in danger. If the
answer is yes, he does have a right to
use lethal force. And in fact, in
Minnesota, there's a specific law that
allows officers to use deadly force by
shooting at an oncoming vehicle. So, I
think the secretary may be correct here.
&gt;&gt; Do you think, and I'm just want to play
devil's advocate because this is
something that is highly debated right
now. It it is true just by the statue
alone, it looks like that the officer
acted according to the statute. The
Supreme Court has ruled on uh what
officers feel is imminent fear. It is
true that she impeded the officers and
they have footage of her doing it the
entire day, but how do you link that to
a broader uh push for domestic
terrorism? I think that's the part where
some people struggle.
Well, it goes down to the motive. Was
this done to be anti-govern
and to try to change the behavior of
ICE? And if the answer is yes, and
there's considerable evidence that that
was her motive, she was part of the
resistance involved in trying to
obstruct and block and hinder ICE, then
sure, that's domestic terrorism. Um, it
would be important if there was a
prosecution here. But of course, the
driver Renee Good is deceased. Although,
uh, you know, you heard the videotape in
which her wife was saying, ""Drive, baby,
drive.""
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Well, that could be aiding and abetting
fleeing police with a domestic terrorism
motive. So, you know, it still is
relevant.
&gt;&gt; It's a good point. I want to get your
thoughts on another case. So, federal
prosecutors in Washington DC have opened
up a criminal probe into Fed Chair
Jerome Powell. Um, what is your thoughts
on this? Is there some standing here for
a case such like this?
&gt;&gt; Sure, there could be. Uh, you know, the
question is, did Powell lie to the
Senate Banking Committee about the costs
of renovations of two rather lavish
buildings? The overrun has been
staggering in the billions. Uh the irony
of course is the Fed blames inflation
for that. The question was you know was
Pal dishonest, deceptive,
um you know extravagant, lush amenities,
gardens, fountains, fancy marble, ornate
fixtures, luxury dining room. He denies
any of that, but there is evidence it
does exist. So the US attorney, which
began the probe a couple of months ago,
has now issued grand jury subpoenas. But
just because you do that doesn't mean
criminal charges will eventually ensue.
We'll wait and see.
&gt;&gt; He claims that it is government
retribution because he refuses to lower
the interest rate. Is that going to be a
credible defense for him?
&gt;&gt; Well, it could be under uh the the label
of, you know, uh retribution and
selective prosecution. is the sort of
thing that others like James Comey,
Leticia James have made in their
respective cases. So, it is a possible
defense here.
&gt;&gt; Copy that, Greg Jared. Thank you so
much.

Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","The city of Minneapolis has been in
focus as protests break out after the
deadly ICE involved shooting last week.
We've all seen this video of the moment
it all played out. Let's watch.
&gt;&gt; That's fine, dude.
&gt;&gt; I'm not mad. Show your face.
&gt;&gt; I'm not mad at you.
&gt;&gt; It's okay. We don't change our plates
every morning. Just so you know, it'll
be the same plate when you come talk to
us later. That's fine. US citizen,
former,
you want to come at us? You want to come
at us? I say go get yourself some lunch,
big boy. Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Out of the car. Get out of car.
&gt;&gt; Get out of the car.
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; Let's bring in now Minneapolis Mayor
Jacob Fry. Mr. Mayor, thank you for
being here. In the immediate aftermath
of that shooting, this was your
response. Watch.
They are already trying to spin this as
an action of self-defense.
Having seen the video of myself, I want
to tell everybody directly that is bull.
And I have a message for ICE.
To ICE, get the out of Minneapolis.
&gt;&gt; In hindsight, Mr. Mayor, was that the
appropriate response?
&gt;&gt; I stand by exactly what I said. And to
be clear, what I was responding to was
an immediate conclusion that had been
drawn by the federal government where
they said, ""One, the ICE agent was
acting in self-defense and then shortly
thereafter saying that the victim was a
domestic terrorist."" Uh, we need to be
doing everything possible right now to
have a full and fair investigation. And
my deep concern is when the conclusion
is drawn by the government that's
actually doing the investigation itself,
it's much harder to trust the
investigation. We need to make sure that
the American people can earn and gain
that trust. And yes, I think there's
deep concerns with having exclusively
the FBI and not our Bureau of Criminal
Apprehension at the state level
conducting the investigation itself.
This is an entity that has police
officers and law enforcement and
attorneys, people that have deep
experience in investigating cases
involving an officer involved shooting.
And by the way, they've come to
conclusions and investigated cases that
have resulted in charges and the lack
thereof. And so, you know, our pitch is
look, we no none of us should hide from
the facts here. And if we're not hiding
from them, then let's make sure it's a
full and fair investigation. And would
you agree that no one should be jumping
at conclusions until we have that
investigation and then we'll find out
what facts can come to light?
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm grateful that I'm not the one
investigating this, nor is the city of
Minneapolis. And when you have the
secretary working at the federal
government saying immediately that this
was an action of self-defense. Uh when
you have the federal government booting
the state government from the process
entirely. Yeah, there's concerns
associated with that. I mean, look, we
we've all seen the video. I don't need
to pass judgments here on it. Uh but
what I do know and this is the bottom
line is look I may have disagreements
with some people uh that are part of
your audience but I hope that people can
trust that I love my city. We are
experiencing an extraordinary comeback.
Crime is down in virtually every
category in virtually every
neighborhood. Small businesses were
opening and this whole chaos that's
taking place. Yeah. It's it's setting us
back. And so my ask is simple. Let us
have that beautiful rebound. Let's keep
the safety improvements going. Let's
keep these small businesses opening. And
right now it's getting hard because
yeah, you've got people that are afraid
to go into work. Schools have shut down.
I mean, we've only had two shootings as
of recent in the city this year, and one
of them was the ice ICE situation that
you just pointed out.
&gt;&gt; Would you agree, Mr. Mayor? You ask ICE
to get the f out of your city. Here's
the little secret. ICE, I'm sure, would
like to not have to be doing the surge
operations, but because of four years
under the President Biden
administration, you had unprecedented
number of illegal migrants coming across
the border, many of them turned out to
be criminal illegal aliens. And now they
are going after those individuals. We
can show you just a litany of excuse me
scores of illegal criminal aliens that
have been apprehended in the past few
days that have included everyone from
from murders to to sex assault of
minors. These individuals were roaming
free in your city because your policies
did not cooperate with detainers and so
ICE is then going to get these people
off the street. you would agree that the
streets are safer without these
individuals on your streets.
&gt;&gt; Uh, look, in Minneapolis and in
Minnesota, we are anti-murder. We are
anti-rime. We are for improving the
safety wherever we can. And by the way,
we have worked with administrations both
present and past to drive down crime.
We've worked with the DEA, the ATF, the
FBI to prosecute and charge violent
crime. Uh we've worked to get
perpetrators of violent gun crime off
the street, narcotics off the street. Uh
in fact, the work that was conducted was
so successful, it resulted in the lowest
number of shootings on record on, for
instance, the north side. We are willing
to work with people when it's about
murder and when it's about crime. But
the truth is that this ain't about that.
If this were about that, we'd have many
uh important areas where there would be
areas where we could work together. Uh
this, however, is the largest
immigration enforcement action on record
in the United States. And so I would
just ask you, why is the largest scale
immigration enforcement action taking
place where we don't even have that many
undocumented immigrants? Why would it
not take place in Texas or Florida or
Utah where you do actually have those
large numbers of undocumented
immigrants? Uh because that's where it
would actually make more sense. But
again, if if the issue is murder or
crime, the answer is we do work with the
federal government. In fact, we're
presently doing that. We're presently
doing this. The truth is it's not about
murder or crime. Be it's not.
&gt;&gt; You mentioned Texas in Florida. You just
had a surge in Louisiana and you didn't
see any of the commotion that you are
seeing now in your city because all of
those states fully cooperate with ICE
detainers. Just look at some of the
videos, Mayor Fry, that we have seen of
these protesters, many of whom you have
praised. You've called them heroes for
being out there ex exercising their
first amendment rights. But they've gone
farther. They're blocking the
operations.
Look at take a look at some of the the
videos. You've seen these.
&gt;&gt; I'm happy to look at videos. I've I've
seen it happening live.
&gt;&gt; Well, watch this.
&gt;&gt; Do Do you want to
&gt;&gt; get the out of here?
[Applause]
SHAME ON YOU. SHAME. SHAME. SHAME.
[Music]
[Applause]
You want to shoot me in the face?
Do you right here like
[Music]
&gt;&gt; and and so that that's just a sampling
of it. You're seeing it in real time.
You are aware that 18 US code 111 makes
it a federal crime to impede, interfere,
or even assault officers. And we see the
protesters crossing a line of
protesting, throwing rocks, hitting
cars, and in interfering in in the
federal government's view of their
operation of carrying out federal
immigration law enforcement.
&gt;&gt; We have had uh perhaps tens of thousands
of people peacefully protesting in the
streets and at the same time, yeah, they
are going to stand up for their
neighbors. And what we are seeing time
and time again is unconstitutional
conduct by ICE. ICE is not new. Our
separation ordinance in the city is not
new. Uh ICE has been around for decades.
So has our separation ordinance. What is
new? What is new is the way that the
Trump administration is presently
conducting themselves. Now again,
&gt;&gt; so if this were about murder
&gt;&gt; or Yeah, we do have a lawsuit. Let's
let's let's talk about that. So, so
legal analysts, not just on Fox News, on
CNN and other networks are saying that
this holds no water. There is no basis
for it. You're telling me here on Fox
News that you support uh law enforcement
removing murders and rapists. So, what's
with the lawsuit?
Well, because what is happening right
now through ICE is not about getting rid
of murderers. What we see right now is
discrimination taking place only on the
basis of race. Are you Latino or are you
Somali? And then it is indiscriminate
thereafter. In other words, they are
pulling people off the streets. They
have pulled US citizens off the streets.
And you don't need to take my word for
it. At this point, this has been very
well documented. And also, you don't
need to take my word for it. Listen to
Trump.
Trump himself is saying that this is
about retribution. He's saying that
there is a reckoning and a retribution
that is coming. And so again, if this
were about murder or rape or crime or
fraud,
then look, we have worked together, not
just with the Biden administration, with
the past Trump administration, with the
Bush administration. We have worked with
a number of different administrations to
successfully drive down crime.
&gt;&gt; President Trump about that. and so
&gt;&gt; secured the border, which is what he ran
on. Do you give him credit for securing
that border? Now he is going through the
interior with ICE operations to remove
the criminal illegal aliens that came in
that open border of the previous
administration. I think at the end of
the day, let me get you on record if I
can, Mr. Mayor. Do you support
abolishing ICE?
&gt;&gt; I do not support abolishing ICE. I
however I I absolutely oppose the way
that this administration is conducting
themselves with us. Um look there are a
number of entities presently agencies
but isn't that what your lawsuit is
about
&gt;&gt; that are conducting themselves.
&gt;&gt; No you should read the lawsuit. The
lawsuit says that hey you know we so ICE
doing ICE stuff is not what we're
talking about right now. Again we've had
ICE in our city before. We've had ICE in
our state before. It is the fact that
look right now there are there's about
3,000 federal ICE agents in our city
between ICE and border control. You know
how many police officers that we have?
600.
The kind of duress that our city is
experiencing because of this is is
magnified. Um again, crime has been
down. This is not helping. uh chaos has
been dramatically increased by the way
uh that these ICE operations are taking
place and we're again we are looking for
ways to keep this city safe. I hope that
people especially viewing can understand
that we want to keep this city safe.
This is not accomplishing it by any
standard.
&gt;&gt; I appreciate your viewpoint. I want to
get a question in and respect your time
on fraud. But lastly, just one last one.
You mentioned President Trump. So he is
threatening to pull funding from
sanctuary jurisdictions
that have policies such as Minneapolis.
Your reaction?
We have a separation ordinance in the
city. And you know what that ordinance
says? It says that I want our limited
numbers of police officers focusing on
keeping people safe, arresting
perpetrators of violent crime, stopping
car thefts from taking place. That's
what I want them focusing on. You know
what I don't want them focusing on?
Hunting down a a dad uh that just
dropped his kids off at daycare is about
to go work a 12-hour shift who happens
to be from Ecuador. That guy makes our
city a better place. Uh so again, if
we're talking about arresting violent
criminals, Minneapolis does not oppose
that. But that's not what is taking
place in the streets of our city. people
who are American citizens.
&gt;&gt; I appreciate that.
&gt;&gt; I want to say this again. American
citizens are being taken off our streets
right now. And I hope any American
citizen out there can understand how
concerning that is.
&gt;&gt; I appreciate freedom. We should be about
freedom in this country. We should be
about liberty. And when you are an
American citizen that is being picked up
by a federal agent of any
administration,
&gt;&gt; we should all be saying, you know what?
Let's take a beat. Let's think this
through. Maybe. Maybe this isn't right.
&gt;&gt; There's two sides to this story. You
mentioned an Ecuadorian migrant. Are you
familiar with Victoria Eene Harwell, an
Ecuadorian illegal immigrant in August
of 2024, driving drunk, crashed headon
into Victoria Harwell, killing her. Her
14-year-old daughter survived and her
sister. ICE released her not I mean uh
local Henipin County released her not
once but twice and didn't cooperate with
ICE detainers. Why not since you're in
favor of removing them cooperate with
ICE? Whether you have this this
sanctuary policy that the DHS says it
is. You call it a separation ordinance?
Why not just cooperate and make it safer
for everyone involved, the community,
the officers, and even the migrants?
Uh my position here is pretty
straightforward and that's this. Uh if
you commit a crime, if you commit fraud,
if you commit a carjacking or a
murderer, you should be investigated,
charged, prosecuted,
held accountable, and yes, arrested and
put in jail. Um that is my position. if
you commit a crime and you are a problem
on the streets of the city of
Minneapolis that has made us less safe.
&gt;&gt; What I am saying is that a lot of the
people that ICE is picking up right now
in our city are not a problem for
Minneapolis. They've opened businesses.
They've been here for longer than I've
been here. They contribute so
beautifully and greatly to our city.
They have families here. They're our
neighbors and and yeah, we love them. We
love them and we care about them. And I
hope that people throughout the country
can understand that, you know, we got to
be thinking about other people as if it
were ourselves. You know, what would we
do in these situations? How would we
handle ourselves? And, you know, we care
deeply about our immigrant population.
We care deeply about everybody in our
city. And what we're seeing right now is
the kind of chaos that is being caused
by this massive influx of ICE agents
isn't helpful. Let me let me just turn
quickly and we so appreciate your time
to the issue of fraud. You recently said
fraud is real. There's convictions have
been done and you say that Governor
Walls has taken measures. Uh but but you
also said that you know more could have
been done. Those were your comments on
the Sunday show where you had an
interview on Sunday. And my question to
you is, is that sufficient to the
Minnesota taxpayers for whom billions
was stolen to just say more could have
been done? Would you like to address the
taxpayers and weigh in a little bit more
on where this fraud investigation goes?
&gt;&gt; I would like to address it. U more could
have been done, more can be done. And I
think it makes it really clear that this
is not about clamping down on fraud.
These ICE invest these ICE arrests we're
seeing in our city. When the people that
have been investigating the fraud just
walked out of the US attorney's office,
the people that have been investigating
and prosecuting this fraud in the Trump
administration at the US attorney's
office said, ""You know what? What is
happening isn't right. It's not fair.
It's not I mean I don't What is
happening is not okay. And they all
walked out. And so again, this ain't
about clamping down on fraud when the
investigators themselves just left.
&gt;&gt; So Governor Walls has decided he's not
going to run for reelection. Does
Attorney General Heath Ellison bear some
responsibility for why this fraud was so
widespread and was able to go on for so
long without being noticed?
Look,
there have been investigations into this
fraud now for years. Uh people have been
prosecuted, people have been convicted,
and that's the way it should be. Uh when
you commit a crime in this country, you
are held accountable and you go to jail
as an individual. You go to jail as an
individual. entire communities, entire
populations are not held accountable for
the actions of the individuals that
actually did it. And so that's where my
position is. Uh and I again again if we
care if we care about the investigation
of these crimes and I do. Do you find it
concerning that all of the people that
were actually investigating and
prosecuting this crime just walked out?
Do you find that concerning? We just
cover it and we see where the facts lead
us and we will report on it and that is
why we so greatly appreciate your time
and having you come in and weigh the
case there. Griff,
&gt;&gt; thank thank you. Thank you for joining
us. Jacob Fry, mayor of Minneapolis. We
appreciate it.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me.

FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR BILL

BILL, THIS IS REMARKABLE, THAT
YOU HAVE CITY THE OFFICIALS
E-MAILING, PUTTING IT IN WRITING
THAT THEY’RE WORKING WITH
PROTESTERS TO TO TRACK I.C.E.
WHEN THEIR CITY POLICIES,
SANCTUARY POLICIES, HAVE
PROTECTED ILLEGAL CRIMINAL
ALIENS.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
I MEAN, THEY SHOULD BE
COOPERATING WITH I.C.E.
AND IF THEY DID, WE PROBABLY
WOULDN’T HAVE A LOT OF THESE
INCIDENTS THAT WE’RE SEEING NOW.
IT’S INVITING TRAGEDY.
AND WE ALREADY SAW WITH
MS. GOOD’S SHOOTING, YOU KNOW,
SHE HAD STAYED IN HER CAR AND
GOT OUT WHEN THE COPS ASKED HER
TO, CEDE BE WALKING AROUND TODAY
THE -- SHE’D BE WALKING AROUND
TODAY.
IT’S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
THE BURDEN IS ON THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE DOING WHAT THEY SHOULDN’T BE
DOING AND DISOBEY LAWFUL ORDERS.
GRIFF: YOU KNOW, BILL, WHEN I
INTERVIEWED MAYOR FREY, HE
ARGUED WITH ME ABOUT THE STATUS
OF MIN CAP LIS BEING A --
MINNEAPOLIS BEING A SANCTUARY
CITY.
BUT YOU LOOK AT THE POLICIES,
AND THEY SPECIFICALLY DO NOT
COOPERATE WITH I.C.E.
THE CITY COUNCIL JUST WEEKS AGO
ACTUALLY WENT A STEP FURTHER AND
PASSED A LITTLE POLICY TO SAY
THAT THE THE I.C.E. VEHICLES
WERE FORBIDDEN TO TO PARK ON
GOVERNMENT PARKING LOTS.
THEY’RE LEANING INTO THIS.
AND SO I JUST, YOU KNOW, RACHEL
AND I WERE TALKING A LITTLE
EARLIER, IT DOESN’T SEEM LIKE
THIS IS A WINNING PLAY, TO GO
ANTI-I.C.E., WHICH TAX US BACK
TO HOW WE GOT -- TAKES US BACK
TO HOW WE GOT HERE WHICH ALL
BEGINS OF THE RECKLESS OPEN
BORDER POLICIES OF THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION.
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU’RE RIGHT.
BUT IT IS A WINNING PLAY FOR
THEM IF THEY WANT TO PLEASE THE
ACTIVISTS.
MINNEAPOLIS IS A VERY LIBERAL
CITY.
TODAY PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THEIR
LIBERALISM, AND THEY THINK
THEY’RE STANDING UP TO THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
WHETHER THEY’RE DOING IT
LAWFULLY IS NOT THE QUESTION.
YOU KNOW, MUCH WAS MADE ABOUT
CAN YOU TAKE PICTURES.
I DON’T THINK PEOPLE WOULD CARE
SO MUCH ABOUT TAKING PHOTOS IF
THEY WERE, THERE WAS NOT THE
HINT OF VIOLENCE IN THE BACK.
LOOK, THE WOMAN WHO GOT KILLED
WAS A MENACE.
SHE WAS DRIVING A CAR, CLEARLY
THE OFFICER THOUGHT HIS LIFE WAS
IF DANGER.
AND WE’RE GOING TO SEE A LOT
MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE THAT.
YOU CAN’T PLAY AROUND WHEN THERE
ARE PEOPLE WITH GUNS AROUND.
GRIFF: AND IT SEEMS A BIT
SURPRISING THAT OFFICIALS LIKE
MAYOR FREY DON’T CARE ABOUT
THEIR RESIDENTS’ ACTUAL SAFETY.
BECAUSE IT SEEMS THEIR RHETORIC
IS PUSHING THEM TO CROSS THE
LINE IN BETWEEN PROTESTING,
HOLDING SIGNS PEACEFULLY, AND
INTERFERING, IMPEDING AND
ULTIMATELY ASSAULTING LAW
ENFORCEMENT WHICH IS A FEDERAL
CRIME.

THE STATE.
RACHEL: MATT FINN JOINS US LIFE

MATT, GOOD MORNING.

WE'RE ENTERING WEEK THREE OF THE

AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE SHOWING
NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN.

AND UN-AMERICAN TO OFFICERS.
""THE WASHINGTON POST"" REPORTING
ABOUT 1500 ACTIVE DUTY SOLDIERS

COUNTER-PROTESTER THES AT CITY
HALL.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS WARNED HE
MAY USE THE INSURRECTION ACT
HERE IN MINNESOTA WHICH WOULD
ALLOW THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO
USE MILITARY TROOPS TO BRING
CALM.
MEANWHILE, A STATEWIDE DAY OF
ACTION IS SCHEDULED FOR THE

ACTIVISTS ARE ASKING PEOPLE NOT
TO ATTEND WORK, SCHOOL OR MAKE
PURCHASES, AND THE ST. PAUL FED
IF RATION OF EDUCATORS IS ALSO
ASKING PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN

FRIDAY.
BACK TO YOU IN NEW YORK.
GRIFF: MATT FINN LIVE IN
MINNEAPOLIS, THANK YOU.
IT'S JUST CONTINUING TO RAMP UP
AND UP UP AND, AND IT'S
IMPORTANT AS WE CONTINUE TO
COVER THIS STORY TO REMEMBER HOW
WE GOT HERE.
THE RECKLESS OPEN BORDER
POLICIES OF JOE BIDEN --
RACHEL: YES.
GRIFF: -- LED TO THE CRIMINALS,
THE VIOLENT ILLEGAL ALIEN
CRIMINALS THAT I.C.E. HAS GONE
INTO PLACES LIKE MINNEAPOLIS, A
SANCTUARY CITY, TO CLEAN THEM
UP.
AND YOU HAD YESTERDAY STEPHEN
MILLER, DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF,
REALLY RAILING ON TO MINNESOTA'S
LEADERS ACCUSING THEM OF AIDING
AND ABETTING ANTI-I.C.E.
VIOLENCE.
WATCH.
&gt;&gt; THESE ARE ACTS OF
INSURRECTION AGAINST THE LAWS OF
THE UNITED STATES AND AGAINST
THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITED
STATES.
ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO BROKE INTO
THIS THE COUNTRY, WHO THEN RAPED
CHILDREN, ADMIT COMMITTED SEX
TRAFFICKING, PROTECTED,
SHIELDING, SHELTERED, CODDLED,
DEFENDED AT EVERY LEVEL BY THE
LEADERSHIP IN MINNESOTA.
AND THEN WHEN I.C.E. GOES OUT TO
MAKE THESE ARRESTS, THEY UNLEASH
VIOLENT MOB TOSS ATTACK, ASSAULT
AND IMPEDE I.C.E. OFFICERS.
AND THEY REFUSE TO ALLOW THE
CITY POLICE TO PROTECT THOSE
I.C.E. OFFICERS IN THE DUTIES,
WILLFULLY AIDING AND ABETTING
THIS VIOLENCE.
LUCAS: THE KEY WORD, TALKING
ABOUT INSURRECTION --
RACHEL: YEAH, I THOUGHT THEY
WERE AGAINST THAT.
LUCAS: MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO GET
THE THE INSURRECTION ACT FROM
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK THE
DAY BEFORE CELEBRATING THE LIFE
OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, PEACEFUL
PROTESTS.
DOESN'T APPEAR WE'RE SEEING ANY
OF THAT MANY IF THE MINNESOTA.
RACHEL: NO, NOT AT ALL.
THERE'S A LONG HISTORY ON THE
LEFT OF HAVING THESE ACTIVISTS
WHO WILL CREATE VIOLENCE, CREATE
CHAOS, TRYING TO DESTABILIZE
THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION
IS TRYING TO DO, THINGS THAT ARE
WILDLY POPULAR.
THE PRESIDENT HAS A MANDATE.
HE WANTS THE BORDER ISSUE, AS
YOU BROUGHT UP, WAS FRONT AND
CENTER.
DEMOCRATS RECOGNIZED THEY WERE
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF IT, SO NOW
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS WE DON'T
LIKE THE WAY YOU'RE DOING IT.
AGAIN, THEY FIND THEMSELVES ON
THE SIDE OF KILMAR IF ABORREGO,
ALL THE PEOPLE WE PUT UP ON THE
WALL LAST WEEK SHOWING THAT THEY
WERE MURDERERS, RAPISTS, AS
STEVEN MILLER SAID.
AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED
TERRIBLE CRIMES, PEOPLE THEY ARE
PARENT IF WOULD WANT OFF THE
STREETS.
I THINK THE POLITICAL QUESTION
HERE IS THIS IS NOT TALKING
ABOUT AFFORDABILITY FROM THE
DEMOCRAT SIDE.
IS THIS REALLY WHAT THEIR VOTERS
WANT?
MAYBE THEIR VOTERS ON THE FAR
LEFT, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE
IN THE HAD HAD MIDDLE?
AND, AGAIN -- IN THE MIDDLE?
MINNEAPOLIS IS THE HOME OF ILHAN
OMAR, A DEEPLY, DEEPLY UNPOPULAR
FIGURE, AND SHE'S BECOME FRONT
AND CENTER ON THIS AS WELL.
SO I THINK IT ALL IS --
LUCAS: THROW IN SOME FRAUD.
RACHEL: EXACTLY.
SHE'S SUDDENLY $30 MILLION
RICHER NOW, AND WE'RE I
UNCOVERING ALL THIS DAYCARE
FRAUD.
I DON'T KNOW IF IN THE LONG RUN
THIS IS GOING TO WORK.
THIS MIGHT BE THEIR BLM.
GRIFF: IT'S A GREAT POINT P
RACHEL, BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED
ILHAN OMAR WHO IS LEANING HARD
INTO THE ABOLISH I.C.E.
RACHEL: YES.
GRIFF: THAT IS NOT A WINNING
MESSAGE.
YOU CAN DISLIKE STEPHEN MILLER
AND THINK THAT HIS RHETORIC IS
TOO HARSH, BUT FACTUALLY, HE'S
CORRECT.
MINNEAPOLIS IS PROTECTING THESE
ILLEGAL CRIMINAL ALIENS.
NOW, THE MAYOR, JACOB FREY,
ARGUES THAT THEY'RE NOT A
SANCTUARY CITY.
THEY HAVE A SEPARATION
ORDINANCE.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY
DO THE SAME THING.
THEY REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH
I.C.E.
THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED THEM OUT
YESTERDAY SAYING MINNESOTA'S TO
SANCTUARY POLITICIANS HAVE
RELEASED NEARLY 470 CRIMINAL
ILLEGAL ALIENS BACK INTO
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES SINCE
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE.
I.C.E. IS WORKING TO REMOVE THE
WORST OF THE WORST CRIMINAL
ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM TERRORIZING
THEIR STATE.
I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT,
RACHEL, THERE'S 1,360 VIOLENT
ILLEGAL CRIMINAL ALIENS
CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY IN
MINNESOTA IF JAILS HELD BY
AUTHORITIES, AND YET ALL I.C.E.
IS SAYING JUST HAND THEM
PEACEFULLY TO US, DON'T RELEASE
THEM TO THE STREETS.
IT KEEPS THE COMMUNITY SAFER,
AND WE DON'T HAVE I.C.E. HAVING
TO MAKE ARRESTS AT LARGE.
RACHEL: WE KNOW A LOT OF THESE
PROTEST ORS ARE PAID, BUT AMONG
THESE PROTESTERS ARE A LOT OF
RICH MOMS PINING FOR THEIR
1960s PROTESTS AND THEIR,
LIKE, IN THEIR, YOU KNOW,
UNIVERSITY OR DAYS.
THOSE LADIES ARE PROTECTED FROM
A LOT OF THIS.
THEIR KIDS ARE NOT GETTING
CROWDED OUT IN SCHOOLS BY
ILLEGAL ALIENS BECAUSE THEY'RE
IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS.
AND THEY'RE LIVING IN
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE, YOU
KNOW, PROTECTED OR GATED.
TO OTHER -- SO IS THEY ARE AMONG
THE PAID PROTESTERS.
BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY
REPRESENT THE COMMON SENSE
PEOPLE.
THE PROBLEM IN MINNESOTA IS
COMMON SENSE IF PEOPLE ARE COWED
INTO SILENCE.
THEY'RE SO AFRAID.
YOU SAW THAT WITH THE CRIME
BEING COMMITTED IN THE DAYCARES.
LOTS OF GOOD PEOPLE SAW THE
CORRUPTION BUT WERE SO AFRAID IN
THAT POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN
MINNEAPOLIS OF BEING CALLED
RACIST, CALLING ALL THE
CORRUPTION.

&gt;&gt; I do not support abolishing ICE. I
However, I I absolutely oppose the way
that this administration is conducting
themselves with ICE. Um, look, there are
a number of entities presently,
agencies, but isn't that what your
lawsuit is about that are conducting
themselves?
&gt;&gt; No, you should read the lawsuit. The
lawsuit says that, hey, you know, we so
ICE doing ICE stuff is not what we're
talking about right now. Again, we've
had ICE in our city before. We've had
ICE in our state before. It is the fact
that look, right now there are there's
about 3,000 federal ICE agents in our
city between ICE and Border Patrol. You
know how many police officers that we
have? 600.
The kind of duress that our city is
experiencing because of this is is
magnified.

Mclofflin back with us and good morning
to you. Thank you for your time. We want
to go through a number of things. So
give us a chance to get in there. Okay.
First on this incident inside the church
in St. Paul. They were looking for
someone by the name of David Easterwood
who was listed as a pastor there. In the
videos that we see that's not David
Easterwood, is it? And if not, what
comes after that next?
&gt;&gt; No, that was the lead pastor you saw
there, Bill. But this is outright
hysteria we are seeing from the left.
And this should be the easiest thing in
the world for Tim Walls and Mayor Fry to
condemn. This shouldn't be a Republican
or Democrat issue. These are worshippers
who are practicing their First Amendment
rights to worship. And yet those rights
were trampled on by these protesters who
trespassed and began intimidating these
Christians uh worshiping. So, I'm glad
to see the Department of Justice is
taking this incredibly seriously, and I
hope we see mug shots soon.
&gt;&gt; Uh, Mayor Fry talked about protesters
overall. He was on CNN on Sunday. Watch.
&gt;&gt; Invaded, under siege, occupied,
you know, use whatever word or
superlative that you want to attach, but
the bottom line is what is taking place
is designed to intimidate. It is not
fair. It's not just, and it's completely
unconstitutional. They're peacefully
protesting. They're standing up for one
another. Uh, and you know, like I said,
it's not just going to be resistance
here in this city. We're not backing
down. Um, we're not going to be
intimidated.
&gt;&gt; In addition to that, there's an
investigation now into Mayor Fry. Can
you tell us more?
&gt;&gt; I'm going to leave that to the
Department of Justice, but so much of
what Mayor Fry said there is abjectly
completely false. Oh, I mean, let's
compare what we see in uh places like
Florida or Tennessee where we have state
and local governments work with us. Out
of Florida, we've had 40,000 arrests. We
see public safety. We see peace. We see
calm. Just to pose that to what we see
out of Minnesota where we've had a
little over 10,000 arrests. And we see
riots. We see our law enforcement
officers are being pummeled with rocks
over the weekend. There were fireworks
that were launched at them. They're
being spit on. rampant assaults against
them and so this is not peaceful protest
that we have been seeing. Uh Mayor Fry
should be condemning this. Tim Wallace,
they have to get their city and their
state under control.
&gt;&gt; So Tom Holman has been um outspoken and
I know what you're about to hear is not
going to surprise you, but it sets us up
for a particular question after this.
Watch here.
&gt;&gt; Rhetoric from the mayor and the governor
emboldens that small percentage who go
beyond protesting to criminal activity.
They feel empowered to interfere, impede
with ICE officers, put their hands on
ICE officers, throw weapon, you know,
throw stones and frozen water bottles at
ICE officers. So he was talking about
the rhetoric there. Big picture, Trisha,
I know all of this is important and all
these videos tell a a certain story. Did
you specifically ask the lawmakers in
Minnesota cooperate with you when
[music] it comes to access with the
jails? And if so, when did that happen?
What did they say? And were you ever
granted access to the jails who you
believe hold criminal illegal immigrants
today?
&gt;&gt; Time and time again. I mean, we're
talking about throughout the year, Bill,
that our ICE officers have lodged
detainers. Those detainers have not been
honored. There is a very easy solution
to that, and it's allow our federal law
enforcement, our ICE and CBP officers to
work with the state and local uh
officers on the ground. That's what the
state and local law enforcement officers
want to be doing is enforcing the rule
of law. But if you look at who is in
those jails, currently sitting in those
jails, Bill, 1,370
criminal illegal aliens in Minneapolis's
custody, murderers, rapists, child
pedophiles. Those people should serve
their time and then they should be
turned over to ICE. We have not seen
that. We've seen no cooperation. We have
not been allowed or have those detainers
be honored. That is exactly what we're
asking for today. Mayor Walls and uh
excuse me, Governor Walls and Mayor Fry
should come out today and agree to that.
They should also agree to allowing their
local law enforcement officers to give
our law enforcement officers backup.
That way, when our officers are being
impeded, they're being obstructed, or
they're being assaulted, we don't see
public safety threats and crises like
we've seen the last few days. Um, on a
bigger picture standpoint, ICE is uh
very controversial and it kind of has
been actually not really from the
beginning uh right after 9/11, but
increasingly so. Here's Ruben Ggo. He
thinks it should be scrapped.
&gt;&gt; I think ICE needs to be totally torn
down. Uh, it has to be, you know,
created in the image of what people
want, right? And what does that look
like? From my experience running in
Arizona in a very hard hard state when
it comes to immigration, immigration
issues, people want immigration
enforcement that goes after criminals,
right, and focuses on criminals and
immigration enforcement is actually
focused on security and not the goon
squad that has come from Stephen Miller
and Donald Trump.
&gt;&gt; So with language like that, it doesn't
sound like anyone really wants to be uh
civil and try to solve the problem. And
I think one of the big issues here,
Trisha, is that it doesn't seem that
somebody like Ruben Ggo and President
Trump that they can even agree on what
the problem is that they're trying to
solve. Give you the final word.
&gt;&gt; Well, how deeply on serious during a
serious moment for our country, the
facts on the ground, uh, Dana, is that
70% of those who have been arrested
under the Trump administration, 70,
either have prior criminal convictions
or pending criminal charges against
them. That does not even include known
or suspected terrorists, of which we've
arrested over a thousand. That doesn't
include gang membership. That doesn't
even include being wanted for a violent
crime in your country of origin or a
third country. So, he simply doesn't
have the facts on the ground. What he
should be doing is thanking our ICE and
CBP law enforcement for the great work
that they've done. They wake up every
single day, risk their lives to arrest
child pedophiles, rapists, murderers,
known and suspected terrorists, criminal
gangs that terrorize our communities and
his constituents.
&gt;&gt; 1,370.
I have not heard that number until
today. Uh we will How many other states
are not cooperating, by the way, right
now? Currently,
&gt;&gt; well, it's not just uh states
themselves. There's also jurisdictions
within the state. So when you boil it
down, it can get to cities and other
jurisdictions. So I'd have to come back
to you on that exact number. But you
know, there there's a very easy solution
here. Self-epport now. There doesn't
have to be these arrests. If people
leave now, take the thousand exit bonus,
free flight home, and potentially
preserve the opportunity to return the
right way. Great option for those in
this country illegally.
&gt;&gt; Trish McLolin, thanks for coming back
today. Uh we will follow it as we always
do. Thank you so much. Thank you.

SHARE COLLABORATIVELY.
THEY CAN SEE AND FOR WHAT IT IS.
&gt;&gt; Sandra: WE WANT TO BRING IN
GREG BOVINO, THE BORDER PATROL
CHIEF.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
SHARE WITH US WHAT'S HAPPENING
AND DESCRIBE THE SITUATION.
&gt;&gt; SURE, SANDRA.
THE SITUATION OF THE FEDERAL
BUILDING, THE WILLFUL BUILDING,
QUITE ACTIVE PROTESTS OUT FRONT
AT THE BUILDING.
THERE ARE SOME RECENT ARRESTS
MADE, SOME OF THE PROTESTERS AND
RIOTERS, THEY WANT TO BLOCK THE
ROADS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO
ITS JOB.
THEY ARE BEING PUSHED OUT OF THE
ROAD AND IF THEY DON'T MOVE THEY
ARE BEING ARRESTED.
&gt;&gt; John: GREG, IT'S JOHN.
WE KNOW IT'S BEEN AN AWFULLY
BUSY COUPLE WEEKS FOR YOU.
WE SEE THE RESIST FLAG IN THE
FOOTAGE THAT WE WERE LOOKING
OUT, ALTHOUGH OUR CAMERA HAS
JUST GONE DOWN.
DON'T KNOW WHY.
COULD SIMPLY BE A BATTERY.
IT'S ECHOING THE WORDS OF THE
GOVERNOR OF MINNESOTA LAST NIGHT
WHO SAID PEOPLE SHOULD GO OUT
AND RESIST I.C.E., THEY SHOULD
TAKE CAMERAS AND FILM
EVERYTHING.
THIS IDEA OF HOLDING PROTESTS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE FEDERAL
BUILDING, RIGHT WHERE I.C.E. IS,
THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE
PROTESTERS AND I.C.E., IT IS IN
YOUR MIND, IS THAT THE WAY
PEOPLE SHOULD BE PROTESTING
I.C.E.'S PRESENT OR SHOULD THEY
HAVE AN AREA WHERE PROTESTERS
MAKE THEIR VOICE HEARD BUT AVOID
DIRECT CONFRONTATION?
&gt;&gt; NO ONE WANTS DIRECT
CONFRONTATION, JOHN.
WE RESPECT THE FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHTS OF ANYONE TO AIR THEIR
GRIEVANCES.
WE JUST ASK GRIEVANCES TO BE
AIRED CIVILLY AND NOT WITH
VIOLENCE.
THAT'S WHERE IT SEEMS A LOT OF
THESE INDIVIDUALS CROSSED THE
LINE, WHETHER THEY ARE AT THE
WHIPPLE FEDERAL BUILDING OR
OTHERWISE.
BECAUSE THEY ARE ENCOURAGED, AND
WE HAVE SAID MANY TIMES, THEY
ARE ENCOURAGED TO STEP OVER THAT
LINE AND AS YOU SAY, RESIST.
AND THAT IS FAR AND APART FROM
EXERCISING FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT
TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
&gt;&gt; Sandra: GREG, COULD YOU
CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT TEARGAS
OR OTHERWISE WAS DEPLOYED A FEW
MOMENTS AGO WHILE WE WERE
WATCHING THAT?
&gt;&gt; I WAS THERE AS THEY MADE THE
ARREST.
IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A LOT OF --
THAT THERE WAS ANY TEARGAS
DEPLOYED.
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME SMOKE
DEPLOYED.
BUT THERE WAS UNREST MADE AND IT
LOOKS LIKE A TEXTBOOK PRECISION
ARREST OF A TARGETED INDIVIDUAL
THAT WAS CAUSING SPECIFIC
PROBLEMS AND HAD BEEN CAUSING
PROBLEMS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.
&gt;&gt; Sandra: GOTCHA.
WE ARE WATCHING WHAT HAPPENED A
FEW MOMENTS AGO.
THAT WAS UNREST MADE OF A SINGLE
INDIVIDUAL?
&gt;&gt; YES, SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL.
OFTEN TIMES INDIVIDUALS WILL TRY
TO OBSTRUCT OUR ABILITY OUT OF
THAT FACILITY.
HE PRESENTS A PROBLEM FOR THE
GOOD CONDUCT OF OPERATIONS.
IT'S UNSAFE FOR THE CIVILIAN
CROWD.
IT'S UNSAFE FOR AGENTS, SO FOR
US TO MAKE THAT A SAFE AREA,
IT'S KIND OF COMMON SENSE.
DON'T STAND IN THE ROAD.
I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED THAT
WHEN WE WERE VERY SMALL 
&nbsp;
CHILDREN.
&gt;&gt; John: CLEARLY THE
PROTESTERS AT THIS POINT ARE
TRYING TO INHIBIT TRANSIT IN AND
OUT OF THE WILLFUL BUILDING
FEDERAL FACILITY AND IT APPEARED
A SHORT TIME AGO WHEN THE
OFFICERS MOVE FORWARD TO CLEAR
THE CROWD OFF THE STREET THEY
WERE TRYING TO LET SOME VEHICLES
COME IN AND OUT OF THAT FACILITY
BUT THAT'S PART OF THE PURCHASED
STRATEGY TO TRY TO STOP THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM
CONDUCTING ITS BUSINESS.
ALL OF THESE PROTESTS, THE
PROTESTS FROM THE --
CALLS FROM THE GOVERNOR AND THE
MAYOR TO TRY TO GET I.C.E. TO
SAY THIS ISN'T WORTH IT, WE ARE
PACKING UP AND LEAVING.
THAT DOESN'T APPEAR LIKE THAT'S
ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
IS DOUBLING DOWN.
THEY HAD TO PUT EXTRA OFFICERS
ON THE LINE BECAUSE AGAIN TO THE
POINT WE WERE MAKING EARLIER
WITH NICOLE PARKER, THERE IS NO
BACKUP FROM THE LOCAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
IT ONLY LOOKS LIKE WHAT THE
POLITICIANS IN MINNESOTA AND
MINNEAPOLIS ARE DOING IS
ENCOURAGING THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT TO FLOOD MORE
RESOURCES TO MINNEAPOLIS.
IS THAT CORRECT?
&gt;&gt; AND JOHN, EXACTLY.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE
OTHER AREAS WE HAVE OPERATED IN.
ILLINOIS AT THE FEDERAL 
&nbsp;
FACILITY.
WE SAW SOME OF THE TACTICS USED.
BUT EVEN IN ILLINOIS UNDER
GOVERNOR PRITZKER, THEY STILL
ALLOWED STATE AND LOCAL TO COME
IN AND WORK WITH THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THAT FACILITY
SAFER.
THAT'S ALL WE ASK HERE AT THE
WHIPPLE FACILITY.
SAFE INGRESS, EGRESS WE CAN
CONDUCT THESE OPERATIONS.
ANYTIME WE CAN WORK WITH STATE
AND LOCAL AS WE DID IN
LOUISIANA, SOMEWHAT ILLINOIS,
NORTH CAROLINA, OTHER PLACES,
THAT'S SUCCESS FOR ALL OF US.
&gt;&gt; Sandra: GREG, WE WERE
DISCUSSING WITH PAUL MAURO A
SHORT TIME AGO THE MIDDLE OF THE
DAY, THE TIME OF DAY.
IT'S A WORKDAY.
CLEARLY IT'S THURSDAY.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE PROTESTING?
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]
SANDRA, GREAT QUESTION.
SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS DO
COME FROM OUT OF STATE.
SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS COME
TO PROTEST.
WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT HOW
THEY ARE PROTESTING.
ARE THEY BEING PAID?
WHAT ARE THE GROUPS ASSISTING,
AIDING AND ABETTING THESE
RIOTERS, AGITATORS?
&gt;&gt; Sandra: I THINK MAYBE WE
LOST YOU, GREG.
OKAY.
HE'S THERE, JOHN.
WE WERE HAPPY WE WERE ABLE TO
GET HIM AS LONG AS WE DID BY
PHONE.

Nancy Mace. She sits on the House
Oversight and Armed Services Committees
and is now running for governor of South
Carolina. How do you see the Minneapolis
protests, Congresswoman?
&gt;&gt; Well, it's all very extreme. And you
think about, you know, they're attacking
law and order and saying that ICE is
extreme. There's nothing extreme about
law and order. What you're seeing is the
extremities in lawlessness, lawlessness
in the streets of Minnesota. And I blame
Governor Walls. He is the top leader in
the state of Minnesota, uh, leading the
state into chaos. And I hope that
President Trump will use whatever means
necessary to bring calm, um, to bring
law and order to the state of Minnesota
and protect the people that live there.
&gt;&gt; The mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Fry,
says that uh, this is, pardon me, this
is this is sort of about love. I'll let
him say it. Listen to this.
This is not just about resistance here
in Minneapolis. It's about love. We are
showing something far more powerful and
consequential here, which is love. We
are standing up for one another. You've
got neighbors helping neighbors. You've
got people uniting and coming together
in this beautiful way. And obviously
we've got these threats out there from
the federal government that were
literally designed to intimidate
Minneapolis residents to intimidate me.
&gt;&gt; Uh he's talking about neighbors helping
neighbors, but I want to put up a
screenshot of some of the people that
ICE has arrested so far in Minneapolis.
Um people convicted of armed robbery. Um
criminal convictions there. 12 criminal
convictions on Ming Kongyang, Joshua
Forno, who uh was convicted of
thirdderee criminal sexual assault, and
the list goes on. Those are some of the
people that ICE has arrested, but you
wouldn't know that from hearing the
mayor talk. Your thoughts?
&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't under I didn't know that
love meant hugging on rapists,
murderers, and pedophiles. If that's his
definition of love, I don't want any
part of it. And I didn't know that love
meant throwing bottles at federal
agents. It's wild the way that the left
is trying to describe this narrative,
rewrite history when we all can see it
in black and white on TV. The violence
that is unfolding, the defense and the
excuses for hitting an ICE agent with a
vehicle. It's really outrageous and I
just it's perplexing that this is even
happening in the United States of
America.
If none of this were happening, uh I
suppose the the top headline in
Minnesota would be the 9 billion plus in
fraud committed by uh a number of Somali
immigrants and others. Uh fleecing the
state and federal government out of all
kinds of money. Tim Waltz typically
would be held accountable for that, but
he doesn't have to worry about that
right now because of all these protests
going on or at least um it's burying
that story in the uh in the in the
papers.
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't think think anything
anything's going to stop Secretary Scott
Bessent. He has stated that the Treasury
is going to go after the fraud in
Minnesota, and I believe in Secretary
Bessant being able to do that. And I
hope that he investigates Tim Walls and
Keith Ellison to the fullest extent of
the law. And if that means a cold, dark
cell to pay for potential crimes and
cover up that may have been committed,
then so be it. We need to come back to
an era of law and order in this country
where people who break the law are held
accountable. I am tired of judges and
magistrates and prosecutors not
prosecuting, not throwing people in
jail. I don't care the crime. We need we
need to bring lawlessness. We need to
take it off the streets and bring law
and order back to America. That
&gt;&gt; that may be. But Quinnipiac took a poll
and asked Americans how they feel about
the way ICE is handling the immigration
laws in this country and 40% say they
approve while 57% say they disapprove.
What do you attribute those numbers to,
Congresswoman?
&gt;&gt; Certainly, I attribute a much of that to
the lies that are being told in the
mainstream media. The truth that's being
hidden from the American people. I can
tell you running for governor here in
South Carolina, that's not the way
people feel. We respect ICE. We support
ICE and we absolutely uh support the
deportation of criminal illegal aliens
here in South Carolina.
&gt;&gt; Your committee in Congress is going to
be holding a a roundt this week
bipartisan. That's kind of a rare thing
in Washington these days on internet
crimes against children. What are you
hoping to accomplish?
What I'm hoping to accomplish is showing
the American people that partisanship
stops at the door when we're talking
about protecting children. We've seen a
number of uh pieces of legislation that
have come to the floor that have been
drafted that I filed or others have
filed to protect children. And in the
advent of AI, uh, deep fakes, the kind
of the way that technology is advancing
so quickly, the way that social media
and algorithms influence our children
and even predators, we want to make sure
that we are working together handinand,
Republican and Democrat alike, to pro
protect America's children. In fact,
just last week on Thursday, I had a
press conference with more than a dozen
moms who were angered about the release
of a pedophile onto the streets of South
Carolina uh hours after being arrested
for violating his bond. And wouldn't you
know, the local mainstream media had a
media blackout and refused to cover the
story even though they were there to
cover the story. And so, I'm going to be
working overtime with people on both
sides of the aisle that want to expose
this kind of behavior in South Carolina
and beyond. We're going to do it
together.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's unfortunate that a lot of the
media have taken sides in political
issues these days. Congresswoman Nancy
Mace of South Carolina. Thanks.

Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","&gt;&gt; Another wild scene out of Minnesota. New
video appears to show anti-ICE
protesters throwing fireworks at federal
agents in Minneapolis last night.
Demonstrations in the Twin Cities are
intensifying with officials reporting
dozens of arrests since Friday. The
cities and state filed a lawsuit against
the Trump administration yesterday,
calling the recent surge of immigration
agents a federal invasion shortly after
Chicago and Illinois announced they
filed a similar suit. Um Paul Mororrow,
let's get your legal take on the
lawsuits first.
&gt;&gt; Okay. It seems to be grounded first of
all in some federal overreach, but also
the First Amendment. And they're going
to send I'm sure they're going to throw
in some equal protection stuff because
every time it comes up any of the
so-called leaders in these places
invokes racism. Okay, which is amazing
when you consider that all the
protesters tend to be not only white but
majority white women. All right, but
that said, the uh that's the basis of
the lawsuit. The rejoinder is pretty
obvious, which is you do your best
business on Main Street. ICE is going to
these places because that's where the
people they got to pick up are. And all
I would add to bring it down to street
level is the following. As ICE goes into
these locations, one of the things
they've learned, and I've heard them
articulate that, and let's recognize, by
the way, that they're they're hiring, I
think, 5 to 10,000 new ICE agents under
the big beautiful bill. So they're going
to have the bodies to do this. In the
past, if you sent in 100 people to do
the operation, now they're going to send
150, 200. Why? Because they're going to
have arrest teams. So, as they try to
enforce and bring the people out, the
worst of the worst, as we've seen some
of the people that have been arrested in
Minneapolis who are wanted for sex
crimes, uh, you know, child predation,
etc. They're going to have dedicated
arrest teams behind the front lines who
are going to look at this, say, ""Okay,
that's the guy. He's shooting fireworks
now at federal officers. That's an
incendiary. That's 5 years in jail with
a sentencing enhancement federally
because obviously Minneapolis PD is all
on furlow. So you go in, you take these
guys, you need the bodies to do this
because it's chaos. And if you don't
have dedicated teams, you lose track of
who did what, the cases fall apart. NYPD
learned this a long time ago. You need
people who are dedicated. I grabbed this
guy. I stay with this guy. I put him
through the system. The arrest sticks.
Now you went out there to play you to
cosplay as a protester when you were on
study hall. Now you're looking at five
years in federal jail. You've got in a
prison. You got to pay for the lawyers.
You have that on your record. That's a
bigger hit and that's way this stops.
&gt;&gt; Harris, we saw last year during the LA
protests that those individuals, the
cosplayers throwing Molotov cocktails at
law enforcement were slapped with tenure
federal charges for the destructive
device that they're throwing. So Paul's
absolutely right. What we are seeing on
unfold before our eyes is is
&gt;&gt; not okay and it is frightening for the
safety of the officers. First of all,
cosplay is so perfect. And I'm glad you
said it again [laughter]
because that's what's going on. I mean,
look, it it would seem that there is no
mission here, just like what we saw on
the university campuses. Who's speaking
up for the people in Iran? Who's even
talking about the Palestinians anymore?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, all of that went away. So,
it is cosplay. And they're out there
right now becoming, you know, people who
are obstructing justice among the crowd.
They'll pay for that, however, legally,
mightily, if they even get more than a
slap on the hand in the state of
Minnesota because I'm getting the
feeling that Governor Walls, for as long
as he sits in that seat, and some
reports are it won't be much longer. And
then you've got Illinois Governor JB
Pritsker, they want to be the flying
ointment to kind of slow the government
down. They can't stop the feds, but the
feds go in, they do a two-tier job of,
you know, isolating and extracting the
worst of the worst. And then you've got
that second flow, which you just
described. I hadn't heard that. the
arrest teams that will come in and begin
to build cases. So, you can slow down
the process, but you can't stop it. So,
yeah, they're just playing a role right
now. And they're being toolled to death.
I mean, they're just paid.
They're incentivized online. More
clicks, more love from the algorithms. I
mean, think about it, people. This goes
on your professional and your your
personal resume for the rest of your
life.
&gt;&gt; So, Martha Paul, as we talked about the
lawsuits that they have now filed
against the federal government, he
mentioned the First Amendment. So
Minneapolis and Minnesota are arguing
that these are targeted operations
against them. They say that the federal
government that President Trump is
targeting them for their rhetoric that
because they've stood up for motans and
and you know for some reason I guess
calling ICE Gustapo is protected but
they feel that these operations are
unlawful. So they're asking for an
injunction saying to stop it right now.
stop this full ICE operation. And then
number two, rule it completely
unconstitutional because as they say, we
don't need it any more than any other
city. And yet, look, the feds are here
in our backyard. Now, I'm not quite sure
uh what the families of the victims of
those horrific criminals that Paul
mentioned, the the sodomizers and the
rapists and the homicidal maniacs that
were extracted out of Minneapolis. I'm
not sure what they would say to that
argument by Walls and Fry. Well, you
would have to compare whether there's
equal treatment in other cities where
you're not hearing those sorts of things
and how those operations are going when
they have cooperation from local law
enforcement. It's a very different
picture. So, you would have to prove
that they're being treated differently
than those places where the model is
working a bit better. And it does remind
me back to the George Floyd days when
police activity was so suppressed in
Minneapolis where the police officers
abandoned the third precinct in the
middle of the night and drove away. The
people who were hurt the most and we
went out there um and talked to people
on the ground there and in neighborhoods
where they were saying we need police.
We need the police and they are not the
uh characterization of the people that
you said are protesting. These are
people who felt that their streets were
unsafe. They had drive-by shootings.
They had more gang activity in some of
these neighborhoods because the police
were hanging back and and and that is
what makes it a very unsafe situation.
So, and I'm also struck by, you know,
you see protesters out on the streets in
New York, the signs change like every
three weeks, right? So now it's this
poor woman who lost her life. Uh Renee
Good. And you're so right. Where where
are the Palestinian signs? I guess
they're in the storage closet.
&gt;&gt; Well, they turned them over and wrote on
the other side.
&gt;&gt; Even if they did that much
independently, I would be impressed.
Here's your new sign, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's it's printing the America out
of Iran ones right now.
&gt;&gt; Right. And I I look at it as uh or a
federal agent that maintained his life.
Thank God. Uh in the face of what could
have been imminent drift.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. and to these lawsuits you there's
no first amendment right for states to
opt out of federal immigration
enforcement. That's not how it works.
And you know unfortunately this seems to
be a case that the Supreme Court is
going to have to take up eventually
because right now you have two competing
claims of sovereignty. You have the
sanctuary states that are claiming they
are somehow exempt from the rules of
federal immigration enforcement. And
then you have the federal government
which is trying to apply the rules that
Congress has passed uniformly across all
red and blue states. This is
unsustainable. You can't have blue
states continue to do this. And more to
the point, you can't have the left
believe that they can nullify the
results of an election, a presidential
election in which the mandate of the
people was clear. They voted for
stricter immigration enforcement. And
right now, the left thinks that they can
nullify that through continued violence
against ICE and against Border Patrol
and the other agencies that are
specifically designed for preserving
American sovereignty and identity.
That's a huge problem and it's going to
be more than just a legal question. It's
really a cultural one as well.

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE
DEATH OF A CITIZEN IN MINNESOTA.
JOINING ME TO DEBATE, DEMOCRATIC
ORDER CONGRESSMAN, MAXWELL
FROST.
WELCOME BACK.
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE, THANK YOU.
IT'S DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN BUT
IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
&gt;&gt; Will: I THINK I DISCOVERED
YOU AS A DEMOCRAT, NOT
REPUBLICAN.
WOULD HAVE FORGIVEN IF A NATURAL
POLITICS LEANED TOWARDS YOUR
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES IT'S A
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST, DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSMAN, MAXWELL FROST.
DO YOU AGREE WITH
DO YOU AGREE WITH 
MAYOR JACOB FREY THAT WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN MINNESOTA IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AT WHICH
VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER LEGAL
SCHOLARS AS IT IS
CONSTITUTIONAL?
&gt;&gt; I DISAGREE ON ONE POINT, WAS
GOING ON ACROSS THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE MANY
THINGS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE,
YEAH, SO RIGHT NOW I.C.E. IT CAN
GO AND ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAW,
BUT NUMBER 1 OF THEIR GOING FAR
BEYOND JUST ENFORCING
IMMIGRATION FEDERAL LAW.
NUMBER 2, WHAT WE'RE SEEING MANY
PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING GIVEN DUE
PROCESS ACROSS THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY, THE CONSTITUTION IS
VERY CLEAR IN THE DUE PROCESS
CLAUSE THAT ALL PERSONS, NOT ALL
CITIZENS, ALL PERSONS ARE
ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS.
YOU KNOW WHO DID NOT GET DUE
PROCESS A FEW DAYS AGO?
RENEE GOOD.
&gt;&gt; Will: FIRST OF ALL I
APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE AGREED
WITH ME, AWAITED WE CAN ADVANCE
HIS CONVERSATION, WHAT I.C.E. IS
DOING IS CONSTITUTIONAL, YOU
DON'T AGREE WITH THE MAYOR OF
MINNEAPOLIS.
BUT YOU BROUGHT UP DUE PROCESS.
I REMEMBER THAT IT WAS SO MUCH
OF THE CONVERSATION LAST TIME WE
WERE TOGETHER.
WE TALKED ABOUT DUE PROCESS, IT
HAS BEEN SOMETHING YOU HAVE BEEN
CONSISTENT TALKING ABOUT.
LAST JUNE U-BOAT OF THE
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION IS
CLEAR, EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY
IS ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS, YOU
WERE TALKING ABOUT
KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA.
THAT IS WHAT WE HAD A DEBATE
ABOUT, DUE PROCESS.
YOU HAVE ALSO CALLED THE I.C.E.
OFFICER INVOLVED IN THIS
INCIDENT NO MURDER.
YOU HAVE SAID IT IS MURDER.
THERE HAS BEEN NO COMPLETED
INVESTIGATION, A LITTLE EVIDENCE
OFFERED UP BESIDES THE VIRAL
VIDEO, I'M CURIOUS OF THAT
CONDEMNATION OF YOURS WITH SO
LITTLE EVIDENCE AND SO QUICKLY
WITHOUT INVESTIGATION IS HOW YOU
ARE TELLING THE REST OF US HOW
TO DEFINE DUE PROCESS?
&gt;&gt; WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT I
SAW THE VIDEO WITH MY OWN EYES
OF THAT MAN LOOKING AT THE WOMAN
IN THE FACE AND SHOOTING HER IN
THE FACE, AS HER CAR SPED AWAY
--
&gt;&gt; Will: YOU USED A VERY
SPECIFIC LEGAL TERM, YOU USED
MURDER.
IT HAS A DEFINITION --
&gt;&gt; THAT IS THE TERM I AM USING.
AS, THE OFFICER IS ENTITLED TO
DUE PROCESS BUT TWO THINGS,
NUMBER 1, RENEE GOOD WAS NOT A
GIVEN PROCESS, THAT I.C.E. AGENT
WAS JURY AND EXECUTIONER IN THAT
MOMENT FOR THAT WOMAN.
NUMBER 2, WITHIN MINUTES DO YOU
KNOW WHO THE FIRST PERSON TO
COME OUT AND LABEL SOMEBODY AND
THIS WAS?
IT WAS THIS ADMINISTRATION, WHEN
KRISTI NOEM WHEN STEPHEN MILLER
CAME OUT AND LABELED RENEE GOOD
A TERRORIST.
WAY!
[INDISCERNIBLE CROSSTALK]
LET ME FINISH!
&gt;&gt; Will: YOU HAVE THE EXACT
SAME THING, THAT YOU ARE TALKING
WITH KRISTI NOEM --
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT TIT FOR TAT.
IT IS DHS THEMSELVES THINK
THEY'RE THE ONES DOING THE
INVESTIGATION, THEY WILL LOOK
INTO WHAT AND DO DUE PROCESS --
OF RENEE GOOD.
THEN YOU HAVE THE SECRETARY OF
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY, THE PERSON ON TOP OF
THIS INVESTIGATION --
&gt;&gt; Will: WE HAVE A LIMITED
AMOUNT OF TIME TOGETHER --
[INDISCERNIBLE CROSSTALK]
YOU HAVE GOT YOUR POINT OUT THAT
IT WAS ALONG FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION TO DEFINE HER AS
A DOMESTIC TERRORIST BUT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT DUE PROCESS, I AM
CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR FIDELITY OR
UNDERSTANDING OF DUE PROCESS,
WHEN YOU DEEM AN INNOCENT MAN
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY, IT
IS PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES
CONSTITUTION.
WHEN HE D- WHEN A MURDER, LET'S
FOCUS ON YOU.
YOU ARE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL --
VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE, ALL YOU
HAVE IS A VIRAL VIDEO.
YOU CONDEMNED THE MAN, BY THE
WAY I THINK YOU ARE LIABLE, I
WOULD BE CAREFUL IF I WERE YOU
FOR DEFAMATION.
YOU, STEVE CARAQUET DOC RIVERS,
SHOULD BE CAREFUL BECAUSE HE
CROSSED OVER THE LINE.
&gt;&gt; I WON'T BE CAREFUL IN TERMS
OF CALLING OUT -- YES, I DO.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, I
WILL SAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN,
RENEE GOOD DID NOT GET THE DUE
PROCESS SHE DESERVES.
THE OFFICER DESERVES DUE
PROCESS.
WILL ALSO CALLING WHAT I SAW IN
THE VIDEO AND I'M A HUNDRED
PERCENT AND MY RIGHT TO DO SO.
THE ISSUES WHEN YOU HAVE THE
PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE
INVESTIGATION THAT IS SUPPOSED
TO GET US THE TRUTH TO THIS,
COMING OUT MINUTES AFTER WE
LEARNED ABOUT THIS, CALLING HER
A DOMESTIC TERRORIST, NOT EVEN A
THREAT --
&gt;&gt; Will: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR LANGUAGE --
[INDISCERNIBLE CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; TO COME OUT AND SAY -- I WANT
TO FINISH MY POINT -- TO COME
OUT AND SAY WE WILL --
&gt;&gt; Will: YOU ARE DOING THE
EXACT SAME THING.
CONGRESSMAN!
IT'S SAD.
IS A TRAGEDY.
I AGREE.
&gt;&gt; I AM GLAD YOU ARE SAYING
THAT!
&gt;&gt; Will: CAN ASK YOUR HUMAN
QUESTION, YEAH, HUMAN FOR ONE
MOMENT, NOT A DEMOCRAT OR
REPUBLICAN.
WANT YOU TO WATCH THIS VIDEO, WE
HAVE ALL SEEN THE RENEE GOOD
VIDEO, LOOK AT THE VIDEO WHAT IS
HAPPENING WITH I.C.E. OFFICERS,
WATCH PEOPLE BLOCKING THEIR
VEHICLES, WATCH THEM IN PORTLAND
AND MINNESOTA.
IT'S HAPPENING EVERYWHERE.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE SEEN ALL THE VIDEOS!
&gt;&gt; Will: HAVEN'T YET ASK YOU
TO THE QUESTION.
WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER, WE CAN
BE HUMAN.
IS THAT OFFICERS, YES?
-- WE HAVE SEEN OFFICERS RAMMED
BY CARS.
MY QUESTION IS -- HOLD ON!
HOLD ON!
MY QUESTION IS, WOULD YOU TELL
YOUR SISTER TO GO BEHAVE IN A
WAY THAT PROTESTERS, EVEN TEEMAC
DID IN MINNESOTA.
WOULD YOU TELL THEM TO BLOCK
OFFICERS WITH THEIR CAR?
WOULD YOU TELL THEM TO DRIVE
TOWARDS OFFICERS OR TELL THEM IN
GOOD CONSCIENCE YOU WILL BE
SAFE?
GO ACT THIS?
THIS IS SMART?
WOULD YOU TELL THAT TO YOUR
SISTER?
&gt;&gt; I AM AGAINST ANY KIND OF
VIOLENCE ON OFFICERS AND ANYONE,
NUMBER 1.
I CAN SEE THAT EASILY.
I CAN ALSO SAY VERY EASILY, THIS
ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING I.C.E.
IN VERY SPECIFIC CITIES, NAMELY
DEMOCRATIC CITIES AND THEY ARE
INVITING THIS CHAOS.
THAT IS WHY, YOU CAN SEE ALL THE
VIDEOS THEY DON'T GO OUT OF
THERE ALONE, THEY GO OUT WITH A
FILM CREW TO GET ALL THIS ON
FILM -- HOLD ON, LET ME FINISH.
IT'S NOT ABOUT BODY CAMERAS.
IT'S ABOUT FILMING TO MAKE A
SHOW OF THE CHAOS THEY ARE
CREATING IN THE CITIES.
THE THIRD POINT, I SEE THE
FOOTAGE THEY HAVE PUT HERE OF
SOME OF THESE PROTESTS, I HAVE
ALSO SEEN THE FOOTAGE OF PEOPLE
HARMING POLICE OFFICERS ON
JANUARY SIXTH AND DONALD TRUMP
IMMEDIATELY PARDONING THOSE
PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
CREDIBILITY ON THIS ISSUE, THIS
ADMINISTRATION HAS NONE.
THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE
INVESTIGATION --
&gt;&gt; Will: HAPPENS AT THE HALF
HOUR OF MY SHOW AS I HAVE A
BREAK I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER, WE
SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER DEBATE
BECAUSE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT
ASHLEY, WHY I.C.E. IS FLOODING A
DEMOCRATIC CITIES IT IS
SANCTUARY CITIES BECAUSE THEY
ARE OF MOST VIOLENT.
BUT BECAUSE OF THE TIME WE SPENT
TOGETHER I WAS A"

&nbsp;NOW, THE FIVE.
&gt;&gt; Dana: HELLO.
IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY AND
THIS IS ""THE FIVE.""
BREAKING NEWS, JUST MOMENTS AGO,
KEITH ELLISON, ATTORNEY GENERAL
AND MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR JACOB FRYE
ANNOUNCING THAT MINNESOTA WILL
BE SUING KRISTI NOEM AND OTHER
DHS OFFICIALS AND THE GOAL IS TO
BLOCK THE ICE ENFORCEMENT IN THE
STATE.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A FEDERAL INVASION OF
THE TWIN CITIES AND MINNESOTA.
IT MUST STOP.
DHS AGENTS HAVE SEWN CHAOS AND
TERROR IN CITIES ACROSS
MINNESOTA.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S
DECISION TO TARGET MINNESOTA
TWIN CITIES.
&gt;&gt; IF THIS WAS ABOUT FRAUD,
YOU'LL SEE AN INVASION OF
ACCOUNTANTS.
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SEE.
WHAT YOU SEE IS PEOPLE BEING
TAKEN OFF OF OUR STREETS.
&gt;&gt; Dana: THOSE WORDS COME AS NEW
PROTESTS ERUPT IN MINNEAPOLIS.
NEW VIDEO SHOWS THE LATEST ANGLE
IN THE DEADLY ICE SHOOTING OF
RENEE GOOD.
HER VEHICLE IS STOPPED IN THE
STREET, THE HORN IS BLARING AND
GOOD IS DANCING IN THE DRIVER'S
SEAT AS OFFICERS SURROUND THE
CAR.
FEDERAL OFFICIALS CALL HER
ACTIONS A THREAT.
BUT MINNESOTA'S DEMOCRATIC
LEADERS SAY THEY'RE NOT AND
DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY.
&gt;&gt; SHE'S LIKE DOING A 3 OR 4 OR
5-POINT TURN.
THREE-POINT TURN OR FOUR-POINT
TURN IS DOMESTIC TERRORIST?
MY WIFE IS A CRIMINAL EVERY DAY
THEN.
&gt;&gt; SHE'S NOT MASKED, SITTING IN
HER CAR PEACEFULLY WAVING CARS
TO GET BY.
YOU SHOULD KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T BE
GETTING IN FRONT OF A MOVING
CAR.
&gt;&gt; IT'S HARD FOR ME LOOKING AT
THE EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE SEEN TO
IMAGINE HOW IT COULD FEEL BODILY
HARM.
&gt;&gt; NO U.S. CITIZEN SHOULD BE
AFRAID OF THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT.
THAT IS WHAT ICE HAS CREATED.
&gt;&gt; THE ACTIONS OF ICE ARE
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, UNLAWFUL.
THEY ARE CRUEL.
THEY ARE ROGUE.
THEY ARE RACIST.
&gt;&gt; AND OVER IN PORTLAND, A MAN
THAT WAS SHOT BY BORDER PATROL.
THEY ALLEGE HE RAMMED A BORDER
PATROL VEHICLE MULTIPLE TIMES
DURING THE TARGETED ARREST.
THE PORTLAND POLICE CHIEF CRIED
WHILE REVEALING THE SUSPECTED'S
GANG AFFILIATION.
&gt;&gt; THEY DO HAVE SOME NEXUS
INVOLVEMENT TO TDA.
I WANT TO SPEAK TO MY LATINO
COMMUNITY.
THIS INFORMATION IS IN NO WAY
MEANT TO DISPARAGE OR TO CONDONE
OR SUPPORT OR AGREE WITH ANY OF
THE ACTIONS THAT OCCURRED
YESTERDAY.
&gt;&gt; A LOT TO GET TO AS WE GET
GOING ON A MONDAY.
JESSE, I BELIEVE NOT SURE QUITE
WHERE TO BEGIN.
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL NOTES.
SO I'M GOING TO --
&gt;&gt; Jesse: SO DHS GAVE A LIST OF
BAD HOMBRES IN MINNEAPOLIS IN
THE LAST TWO WEEKS.
THIS WE HAVE AN ILLEGAL
CONVICTED OF SODOMIZING
CHILDREN.
WE HAVE ANOTHER ILLEGAL
CONVICTED OF RAPE AND
STRANGULATION, A SOMALI ILLEGAL
CONVICTED OF HOMICIDE.
ANOTHER SOMALI OF MAN SLAUGHTER.
A MEXICAN CONVICTED OF HOMICIDE.
WE CAN READ THIS LIST THE NEXT
HOURS.
MINNESOTA IS NOT HOLDING THESE
GUYS.
THEY'RE ROAMING AROUND THE CITY.
YOU HAVE TO GO IN TO THE
NEIGHBORHOODS BLIND AND DO
DANGEROUS TARGETED RAIDS AT
HOMES NOT KNOWING WHO IS BEHIND
THE DOOR AND HOW THEY REACT.
YOU CAN SEE HOW SOME REACT.
THEY DRIVE THEIR CAR IN TO YOU
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
SO YOU GET THIS MILITANT MOM WHO
IS OUT OF HER MIND AND SHE PUTS
HER VEHICLE 2,000 POUNDS AND
BLOCKS A CONVOY OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT, PINNING THE CONVOY
DOWN IN A STREET.
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH GUYS
THAT ARE AT LARGE, CONVICTED OF
HOMICIDE.
AND RAPING CHILDREN.
SO SHE DRIVES IN TO THEM.
WE KNOW THE REST.
BUT WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?
WHY IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
SENDING WOMEN IN TO THE TRENCHES
TO PUT THEIR BODIES IN BETWEEN
FOREIGN CRIMINALS AND FEDERAL
AGENTS?
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?
WHY ARE THEY WILLING TO
SACRIFICE THE LIVES OF AMERICAN
WOMEN TO PROTECT FOREIGN
CRIMINALS?
IS IT BECAUSE OF THE CHEAP
LABOR?
IS IT BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL
POWER THAT THE CENSUS GIVES?
WHAT IS THE REASON?
IS IT BECAUSE THEY'RE IN ON THE
WELFARE SCAM?
MAYBE.
I BET WHEN THEY GET POWER,
EVENTUALLY THEY MIGHT, THEY JUST
RAM AMNESTY THROUGH.
THEY CREATED THE CONDITIONS FOR
THIS POOR WOMAN'S DEATH.
THEIR POUR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN
HERE AND COMMIT CRIMES, STEAL
WELFARE AND THEN THE DEMOCRATS
CIRCLE THE WAGONS AROUND THEM.
SO YOU CAN'T GET THEM OUT OF
HERE.
THAT'S WHAT IS GOING ON.
THEY'RE EXPLOITING THIS WOMAN'S
DEATH FOR POLITICAL POWER.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS NOT
GOING TO BACK DOWN.
&gt;&gt; Dana: JESSICA, IT DOES --
OBVIOUSLY THIS STORY RATCHETED
UP OVER THE WEEKEND AND DIDN'T
CALM DOWN.
THE HECKLERS TALKED ABOUT THE
INTERFERENCE WITH THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
IT'S GROWING ACROSS MINNEAPOLIS
AND ACROSS THE STATE.
WHAT'S JESSE'S POINT ABOUT THE
DEMOCRATS CONDONING OR
ENCOURAGING THIS BEHAVIOR THAT
COULD BE LEADING TO BAD
CONSEQUENCES?
&gt;&gt; I'M ON JUST ABOUT EVERY
DEMOCRATIC LIST SERVED.
I'VE GOTTEN NO E-MAILS TO TRY TO
RECRUIT ME TO DRIVE MY HONDA
PILOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
AND GET IN TO THE FACE OF ICE
AGENTS.
I'M NOT DENYING THAT RENEE GOOD
WAS PART OF A GROUP DOING THIS
AND MAKESHIFT PROTESTS GOING ON
AND HER CAR WAS OBSTRUCTING THE
CONVOY OF ICE AGENTS.
THE ISSUE IS THERE'S NO LINE
BETWEEN HER ACTIONS AND THE FACT
THAT SHE'S DEAD, AND ANY ONE
SHOULD JUSTIFY.
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION ABOUT ICE DOING
THEIR JOB, I'M HERE FOR IT.
I THINK BLUE CITIES SHOULD WORK
WITH ICE AND GET THE BAD GUYS
OUT.
GUESS WHAT?
MAYBE THEY WON'T GO DOOR-TO-DO"

having a walk back comments where she
suggested that ICE agents are criminals.
Watch.
&gt;&gt; This is the thing. You said you were
going after the bad guys.
&gt;&gt; That's what you said, the violent
criminals. And what does it turn out?
The violent criminals seem to be in the
in the agency before folks gather around
and say, ""Oh, she's accusing all of the
folks at ICE of being criminals."" That
is not what I'm doing.
&gt;&gt; Joining us now is senior writer for the
Washington Examiner and Fox News
contributor Joe Kcha. And uh Joe, that
little transition that we played during
the clip, that was before and then after
the commercial break. So, what do you
think of about Whoopi Goldberg's two
opposing comments there?
Uh, Carly Todd, I think Whoopi only
walked back those statements uh because
she was told to do so by ABC's legal
team. And when she walks back these
statements, I I I mean, it's basically
the broadcast version of a hostage
video. You could tell she did not want
to do it, but she had to do it because
ABC's been sued before uh by President
Trump, by the Trump administration, and
they've had to settle to the tune of
millions of dollars. Uh but then again,
if it let's put it this way, the the
main point is that crazy town has only
been expanded in terms of rhetoric from
the from the left. I mean, ICE is
putting away, as we know, and deporting
violent criminals. We're talking about
sex offenders. We're talking about child
traffickers. We're talking about
murderers and rapists. And and every
mayor in every major city where they're
carrying out their operations should be
thankful for making them look better and
making their city safer for everyone.
And again, if you hit any law
enforcement officer with a car or an
SUV, those are considered deadly
weapons. There will be consequences. And
in this case, the ICE officer who was
hit, he had been rammed by a vehicle not
too long ago that required him to get 33
stitches. Overall, ramming or attempted
rammings of ICE officers is up 3,200%
when compared to 2024. But that's a stat
you're simply not reading or hearing
very much in terms of the coverage we're
seeing out of Minneapolis uh by by much
of the media outside of this network.
Tom,
&gt;&gt; feel like the view was due for an
inflammatory headline making comment.
And here we go. They kick off the new
year just the way they always ended the
last one. Uh before we let you go, a new
Gallup poll finding that 45% of
Americans now identify as independent,
rejecting the country's two major
parties, which both sit at 27%. 30
seconds to you. How should Republicans
take that knowledge, take that data and
use it to their advantage in the
midterms?
&gt;&gt; Uh, it is amazing, Todd. I mean, Gallup
has never found this many Americans
claiming uh the independent uh label.
Overall, I'll leave it here. It's likely
more voters are identifying as
independents out of disdain and
frustration for toxic partisan politics
from both sides. They simply don't want
to be associated with this stuff. But
overall, I think that's an opening for
Republicans. Uh because I think in the
end the common sense stuff, tax cuts, a
closed border, all the things that
President Trump has been doing on a
foreign policy perspective and low gas
prices that favors Republicans and not
Democrats, even if they identify as
independents. Todd Carly,
&gt;&gt; I know. And that's why uh President
Trump calling Elizabeth Warren I think
is so important because while people
think that they like the hyperbolic
rhetoric, usually unity is what most
Americans really want to see. Got to
leave it there. Fox and Friends starts
right now.

Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","Well, let's talk a little bit more about
it because we're staying in Minneapolis
where three Venezuelan migrants who
allegedly attacked and ambushed an ICE
agent this week are in custody for what
the Trump administration is now calling
attempted murder.
This ICE agent was executing a targeted
operation against a Venezuelan illegal
alien who was unlawfully present in the
country. They used a shovel or broom to
smash his face in. And so, yes, that
agent had to use self-defense and take
up his weapon to protect his own life.
That is what's happening on the streets
of Minneapolis. That's what's happening
on the streets, unfortunately, of these
Democrat-run cities and states where you
have elected officials who are
encouraging such such violence against
our brave men and women in law
enforcement.
&gt;&gt; Former DHS Deputy Assistant Secretary
Jonathan Fehee joins us now. And
Jonathan, as you well know, the
president came out yesterday and said,
""Look, if this keeps up, I'm going to
have to use the Insurrection Act."" And
for those people who don't know, the
Insurrection Act uh is called for when
quoteun unlawful obstructions make it
impracticable to enforce federal law.
Jonathan, is it time?
Yeah, the the certainly it the situation
fits the law perfectly because you have
consistent obstruction of the law
encouraged by these elected officials.
So, they have no no interest in even
toning things down. I think it's
appropriate, you know, and and President
Trump has let this go on long enough
and, you know, you look back to 2020,
their city burned down because Waltz and
the mayor didn't take appropriate action
and I don't think it's a President
Trump's going to allow that to happen
again. So, I think it probably is going
to happen. I think it's entirely
appropriate and it's entirely legally
justified. We learned this week,
Jonathan, that the ICE agent who shot um
uh Rachel Good uh was suffered some
internal bleeding to the torso. It's a
fact that I'm sure many people who don't
like ICE will not believe no matter who
says it. But he also reportedly served
in the military for years and is a
wellrespected member of immigration and
custom enforcement and has an immigrant
wife himself. Uh so what do you think
his future looks like?
I think it's very scary for him because
if you look back to some of these other
previous incidents, if you look back to
the hands up, don't shoot. Remember
Darren Wilson had to go into hiding. I
don't know what ever happened to him,
but he got so many threats even though
it was found by a Democrat investigation
that he was entirely justified. So, I
think this agent is, you know, he's
going to have a target on his back, his
family will. It's very scary for him
because no agent wants to ever have to
use their firearm, but he he did what he
was required to do and what he was
trained to do. And it's so shameful the
way that, you know, people are talking
about him as if he he murdered this
woman or did anything else. But yeah, he
was in danger. He was injured and he did
what he was supposed to do. And you
know, just like the the incident the
that you were just talking about at the
beginning with the other agent that was
being beaten by people he was trying to
arrest. They have a very dangerous job.
They deserve the support. But yeah, I do
fear for his safety and his future.
&gt;&gt; And I said Rachel apologies. Her name is
of course Renee Good.
&gt;&gt; Understood. And Jonathan, you know,
somebody who's very very concerned for
the health and safety of these border
agents is their boss. Borders are Tom
Holman. He gave this urgent warning.
Listen.
If the hateful rehe doesn't stop,
there's going to be more bloodshed. It's
not over. And what what scares you the
most, there's going to be another death
either of an agent or or or
somebody that's, you know, steps over
that line. I buried border patrol agents
throughout my career. I buried uh
special agents. The worst thing I've
ever done in my career is handed a
folder flag to a spouse or a child. I
pray every night that I never have to do
that again. And obviously we're
referring to border agents and ICE
agents sort of interchangeably here even
though they are two distinct bodies. Uh
Tim Walls asked Donald Trump to tone
down the rhetoric. He asked Donald Trump
to tone down the rhetoric uh literally
minutes after he himself inflamed said
rhetoric. What do you make of that
double standard, that hypocrisy
demonstrated by the current governor of
Minnesota?
&gt;&gt; I would say it's sort of it's
breathtaking, but it's consistent for
the course. and yet talking out of both
sides of his mouth. There's been nobody
that has done more to inflame tensions
than Tim Waltz. I mean, he was just
after that saying, ""Record the ICE agent
and the atrocities they're committing.""
He's called them Nazis. He's done
everything he can to stir things up. And
it's so awful because, you know, a lot
of us, you know, he's sort of a people
make fun of him a lot, but there are
people that take him seriously. So when
he is up there saying things, people
take him seriously and then want to act
out and try to harm ICE agents and harm
law enforcement. And yeah, it's totally
shameful. His job is to be an adult and
he can't live up to that job because he
should get up there and say these agents
have the legitimate right to be here.
They are enforcing the law and if you
want to protest, protest, but don't get
in their way. But instead, he wants
tension. He wants conflict. He wants
violence. And it's so shameful and he's
going to be the primary reason if
President Trump invokes the insurrection
act because Tim Waltz won't simply do
his job and keep his community safe.
&gt;&gt; Uh both sides are accusing the other of
uh escalating tensions and causing chaos
and both sides are right that tensions
are certainly escalating with no signs
of cooling down anytime soon. Former DHS
Deputy Assistant Secretary Jonathan
Fehee, we appreciate you joining us as
always.

&gt;&gt; Sean: THANK YOU FOR THAT
REPORT.
IN JUST A MOMENT DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSMAN RO KHANNA WILL JOIN
US.
LIKE MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES HE
HAS PUBLICLY ATTACKED ICE
OPERATIONS IN MINNESOTA AND
ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT BEFORE WE
FACE-OFF TONIGHT, LET'S TAKE A
STEP BACK, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
THE REALITY ON THE GROUND IN
MINNESOTA AND MANY CENTURY
STATES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
AS WE SPEAK, I.C.E. AGENTS ARE
FACED WITH AN INCREDIBLY
DIFFICULT TASK.
JOE BIDEN, KAMALA HARRIS, THEY
ALLOWED, EVEN ENCOURAGED,
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL
ALIENS FROM OVER 200 COUNTRIES
TO CROSS INTO THIS COUNTRY WITH
A WIDE OPEN SOUTHERN BORDER.
AMONG THOSE, THERE WERE ALSO
SCORES OF HARDENED CRIMINALS,
GANG MEMBERS, TERRORIST,
RAPISTS, CONVICTED KILLERS WHO
SPREAD OUT ALL ACROSS THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY.
I.C.E. AGENTS HAVE A DUTY, IT'S
THEIR JOB, FEDERAL LAW TO LOCATE
THESE CRIMINALS AND ANYONE ELSE
ABUSING OUR SOVEREIGNTY AND
DEPORT THEM BEFORE MORE
AMERICANS ARE HURT IN ANYWAY.
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, SANCTUARY
STATES ARE SHIELDING THESE
CRIMINALS FROM THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT AND REFUSING TO
COOPERATE.
THEY WON'T EVEN HAND THEM OVER
AFTER THEY GET OUT ON BAIL AND
RELEASED FROM PRISON.
INSTEAD FORCING ICE TO CONDUCT
VERY COMPLICATED AND VERY
DANGEROUS RAIDS.
JUST IN MINNESOTA ALONE DURING A
RECENT ICE OPERATION, ICE
APPREHENDED MULTIPLE CHILD
RAPISTS, MULTIPLE CONVICTED
MURDERERS, GANG MEMBERS, OTHERS
CONVICTED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT,
WEAPONS CHARGES AND THREE NATIVE
MINNESOTANS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SINCE
GOVERNOR TIM WALZ TOOK OFFICE.
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NO VIGILS
FOR ANY OF THESE VICTIMS, NO
OUTPOURING OF ANGER, SADNESS, NO
PROTESTING.
YOU WOULD BE HARD-PRESSED TO
FIND ANY DEMOCRAT TALKING ABOUT
ANY OF THE VICTIMS OF ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION.
INSTEAD DEMOCRATS, THEY WAX
POETIC ABOUT CRIMINALS WHILE
VILIFYING I.C.E. AGENTS,
PROFESSIONALS FOR UPHOLDING THE
LAW.
TAKE A LOOK.
&gt;&gt; MASKED MEN JUMPING OUT OF
UNMARKED CARS, PEOPLE
DISAPPEARING, NO DUE PROCESS, NO
OVERSIGHT, ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY,
HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA TODAY.
&gt;&gt; WHEN I SEE I.C.E., I SEE
SLAVE PATROLS.
&gt;&gt; THE DANGERS WE SAW IN NAZI
GERMANY ARE THE DANGERS WE NEED
TO REACT TO NOW.
&gt;&gt; THESE I.C.E. AGENTS RUNNING
AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES LIKE
MASKED BANK ROBBERS, TERRORIZING
WOMEN.
&gt;&gt; FOLKS GETTING SNATCHED OFF
THE STREET BY SECRET POLICE WHO
ARE WEARING MASKS.
&gt;&gt; I.C.E. AGENTS WHO HAVE
FUNCTIONALLY BECOME A SECRET
FEDERAL POLICE FORCE.
&gt;&gt; ICE FEDERAL AGENTS PULLING
UP, TERRORIZING OUR COMMUNITIES,
HOPPING OUT OF UNMARKED VANS,
STEALING AND KIDNAPPING PEOPLE.
&gt;&gt; AN AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT
IN WASHINGTON, D.C., IS
DISPATCHING MASKED AGENTS TO
ABDUCT IMMIGRANTS FROM OUR
STREETS.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS GESTAPO LIKE
BEHAVIOR.
&gt;&gt; THERE SHOULD BE NO QUESTION
TO WHAT OUR COUNTRY WOULD LOOK
LIKE HAD THE CONFEDERACY WON.
&gt;&gt; IT DOES LOOK LIKE A GESTAPO
OPERATION, IT DOES LOOK LIKE THE
GESTAPO.
&gt;&gt; WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
IS DOING HERE IS THEY ARE
PLAYING RACE GAMES.
THEY ARE EXPLICITLY RACIST AND A
NUMBER OF OCCASIONS HERE AND
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO
DO ON OUR STREETS.
&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP'S MODERN DAY
GESTAPO IS SCOOPING FOLKS UP OFF
THE STREETS.
THEY ARE IN UNMARKED VANS
WEARING MASKS BEING SHIPPED OFF
TO FOREIGN TORTURE DUNGEONS.
&gt;&gt; Sean: THESE DEMOCRATS ARE
NOT JUST SMEARING THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION BUT INCITING A
MOB, ENCOURAGING, EMOTIONALLY
DISTURBED BASE TO ENGAGE IN
RISKY BEHAVIOR AGAINST
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS,
ASSAULT ON I.C.E. AGENTS ARE UP
AN UNPRECEDENTED 1300%.
VHIT KILLER ATTACKS ARE UP
3200%.
THERE IS AN 8000% INCREASE IN
DEATH THREATS AGAINST
I.C.E. AGENTS BUT JUST YESTERDAY
GOVERNOR WALZ CONTINUED TO
INFLAME TENSIONS, ACCUSING
AGENTS OF RACISM.
TAKE A LOOK.
&gt;&gt; NEWS REPORTS SIMPLY DON'T DO
JUSTICE TO THE LEVEL OF CHAOS
AND DISRUPTION AND TRAUMA THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS RAINING
DOWN UPON OUR COMMUNITIES.
2-3000 ARMED AGENTS OF THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN
DEPLOYED TO MINNESOTA.
ARMED, MASKED, UNDER TRAINED
I.C.E. AGENTS ARE GOING
DOOR-TO-DOOR ORDERING PEOPLE TO
POINT OUT WHERE THEIR NEIGHBORS
OF COLOR LIVE.
&gt;&gt; Sean: KEEP IN MIND EVERY
ADMINISTRATION SINCE 9/11 HAS
ORDERED ICE RAIDS.
BARACK OBAMA DEPORTED MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE INCLUDING MANY WHO
WERE APPREHENDED DURING ICE
RAIDS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU ARE
SEEING TODAY WITH JUST TWO
DIFFERENCES.
ONE, THE MAJORITY DEPORTATION
INVOLVED NONCRIMINAL ILLEGAL
ALIENS AND TWO, THERE WERE NO
VIOLENT MOBS TRYING TO BLOCK ICE
OPERATIONS AND ASSAULT AGENTS.
APPARENTLY, YOU KNOW, IN THIS
CASE IT WAS DIFFERENT BECAUSE A
DEMOCRAT WAS IN CHARGE BUT OUR
CONSTITUTION IS THE SAME.

is in Minneapolis. Here is more of what
happened. And as Garrett just reported,
this is the kind of scene that you're
seeing on the ground in many areas in in
Minneapolis. We're going to let this
play out a little bit so you can get a
sense of of the tension in this store.
Watch
&gt;&gt; out.
You're a coward.
&gt;&gt; Hold on, babe. I'm going to THE
OUT OF HERE, YOU STUPID. You're a coward
piece of you. And if YOU DIDN'T HAVE A
GUN OR A BAT, I WOULD BEAT THE OUT OF
YOU.
&gt;&gt; Greg Vavino, uh, commander joins me now.
Thank you very much, uh, for being here,
sir. You know, I mean, a lot of things
go through my mind when I see that
video. I'm just curious what your
reaction was. You know what? How does
that feel for you when you walk through
there and people are yelling that kind
of language at you and in your face and
in the face of your agents? And what was
their response when you all got back
into your vehicle? Did you did you talk
about what happened in there?
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Martha, thanks for having me. It's good
to see you again. Um that reaction that
you saw there at at that at that store
is something that has become very common
here in Minneapolis and Minnesota. And
we do talk about that. But one of the
things that we talked about that I want
you and the viewers to know is this is
an operation of contrasts. As you know,
we just got back from Louisiana from
that fantastic operation in Louisiana.
This didn't happen in Louisiana.
Violence did not happen in Louisiana. Uh
the fantastic leadership of Governor
Landry, Colonel Hodes from the Highway
Patrol. But we're here in Minneapolis.
Let me give you a statistic here,
Martha. Well over 20 assaults on federal
officers in three days here in
Minnesota. In Louisiana, I counted one
for that entire 30-day operation. So, a
vast contrast. I can only think that
Governor Waltz and Mayor Fry, you just
had Mayor Fry's speech on there. They're
responsible for what you saw in that
story yesterday and for that violence
that our federal officers confront every
single day here in Minneapolis.
Uh we have a live shot here that we can
take this full um so people can see
what's going on in the streets. It's a
similar sort of tent scene between
protesters and agents. Has this has this
accelerated? I would imagine it has
quite a bit uh since the agent uh killed
Miss Good in her car in that tense
situation.
Martha, the uh the situation has
accelerated. And again, I go back to the
the mayor Fry, Governor Waltz, and what
they're saying about that. They're not
trying to tamp down uh the violence or
anything else. They're actually fmenting
violence and ramping the violence up.
They're supporting these people.
&gt;&gt; We We have a sound bite from Mayor Fry.
Excuse me. Let's play this so people get
a sense of what you're talking about.
Let's watch.
You had a person that was definitively
trying to just get out of there. They
were trying to leave the scene. Uh that
is not a person that's trying to run an
ICE agent over. You have a person that
is trying to protect our city to look
out for our neighbors.
&gt;&gt; You know, you know what strikes me and I
want to just go straight into the Ilan
Omar soundbite here. These people are
apparently in Miss Good's mind. They
know what she's thinking and they know
what's happening even though this
investigation is very much underway.
Let's play on Omar here.
&gt;&gt; She feels scared. She tries to turn the
wheel away and then you see the other
officer who can clearly see the car is
moving move towards the front of the car
which if they are saying that he has 10
years on uh service and is trained, he
should know that you shouldn't be trying
to get in front of uh a moving car.
&gt;&gt; Your reaction to that?
Martha is Ilon and Governor Fry. They
apparently are now experts on uh tents,
dangerous scenes out in the street. Now,
I tell you, it's reprehensible to hear
that. Um, we had an ICE agent who did
not even know he was going to be in that
situation that was confronted with a
4,000lb missile barreling straight at
him. It's funny they don't seem to
mention that, Martha. And uh, it's
&gt;&gt; But you say, let me ask you about this,
Commander Bavino. I'm sorry to interrupt
you, sir. So, she says, Omar says, and I
I guess she's like, you know, a crime
scene analyst now. She's watching this
video breakdown. But she says, ""Why did
he get in front of the vehicle?"" Um,
doesn't he know he's a he's supposed to
have done this for 10 years? Doesn't he
know that's not a good idea?
And Martha, what she doesn't seem to
realize, or maybe she realizes it and
just doesn't want to talk about it, but
these scenes now with hundreds of
agitators and rioters put those officers
and agents in a very difficult
situation. It's not just a vehicle that
they're up against or one subject, but
it's dozens if not hundreds. So, there's
a different scene there that they're
having having to react to. And that
scene is 360° around those agents. Very
difficult. I've been out there with
those agents on the ground for several
days now. It can be chaotic and I'm not
going to secondguess an ICE agent that
was trying to protect his life andor the
lives of others.
&gt;&gt; But the investigation is ongoing. Is
that correct?
&gt;&gt; It is. Our partners there at the Federal
Bureau of Investigation are doing a
fantastic job as they always do to get
those facts and put that put that
investigation together.
&gt;&gt; All right, these let's put this up real
quick. Uh these are five images of some
of the individuals that were arrested as
part of this Minneapolis operation um
Wednesday. Uh these individuals were
apprehended um according to the
reporting here. So you see the names
across the bottom and I'll just tell you
that from left to right you have a child
sex assault conviction, registered sex
offender, attempted sex assault
conviction, attempted criminal sex
conduct conviction,
uh and possession of opium conviction.
So these are all individuals with um
perhaps the exception of the second
person there who does it does not say
there's been a conviction. There's a
charge in that case. These individuals
were all rounded up in Minneapolis as
part of the operation that we've been
watching.
&gt;&gt; Yes, Martha. And what's even more
noteworthy is in addition to those five,
this happens every day. Those type of
individuals are walking the streets
every day in broad daylight, those ICE
agents, Border Patrol, uh, uh, Border
Patrol agents are up against that every
single day. And as they arrest those
individuals, we have members of the
community, some of those weaker-minded
constituents that fall victim to Waltz
and Fry's rhetoric actually coming
against us as we arrest those
individuals. That's that's amazing to
me. Do they want registered sex child
rapist?
&gt;&gt; I guess they want this attempted uh sex
assault conviction person living
next door to them or in their
neighborhood. I want we're going to talk
about this later in the show with our
our panel. um with Yi and Noah coming
up. But but here's just an image. Last
night it was a sort of an underlying
thread through the Golden Globes last
night. A lot of the celebrities were
wearing these buttons that say be good
um in honor of Renee Good. I was just
curious what your reaction is to that
commander before we do that segment.
&gt;&gt; Sure. You know, where are the pins for
Jacqueline Nungare, Molly Tibbitz, Kate
Steinley, Officer Singh, Miss Marin, and
all those other individuals that were
killed, maimed, and raped by illegal
aliens. And what about the angel moms?
How about an angel mom pin? They never
seem to talk about that. I've got a
problem with that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well put. Good argument. Uh,
Commander Bevino, thank you very much.
Good to have you here today. Thank you,
sir.
&gt;&gt; It's good to see you, ma'am. Thank you.

Follow Fox News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/foxnews/","Uh we are learning some new details
about ICE watch. That is a network
across the country that claims to be
legal observers of ICE operations. But
here's what DHS sources tell us. ICE
aims to monitor, track, interfere, and
oppose ongoing federal immigration
enforcement operations. The group is
present in multiple sanctuary cities
across the country. It is linked to
multiple confrontations with federal
agents throughout the country and
allegedly involved in numerous instances
of activists ramming agents with their
cars. Renee Nicole Good was allegedly
part of that group, which has no formal
leadership. Federal authorities are now
looking into those networks to determine
who is funding them and who's training
them. Joining me now to talk about this
is Jeffrey Holstead, Genesis Spokman and
a former Fort Worth, Texas Chief of
Police. Thank you so much uh for being
with us this morning. Greatly appreciate
it. Uh
&gt;&gt; good morning.
&gt;&gt; Good [clears throat] morning to you.
This is a really tough topic for people
across the nation that that are looking
at the videos and and coming out of this
with very different perspectives and
politicians coming out with very
different perspectives. But when it
comes to these organizations like ICE
which exist in many different forms
across the country, ICEWatch itself
across the country but other similar
organizations as well that operate in
similar ways but under different names.
Uh your thoughts on the challenges that
pose they pose particularly when it
comes to aggressive tactics like
including vehicles in their activities.
&gt;&gt; Well, I've had a lot of experience
trying to work with these groups. If you
remember in the early 1990s, community-
based policing was all across America
and it was very successful, very
productive and as a field force
commander. I would actually meet with
protest groups, cop watch and other
affiliated groups and work on their
legal capacity to work with us, march,
protest, and do it peacefully. I think
that's gone away with this political
divisiveness we see around the US. And
now these groups don't want to work with
law enforcement, communicate,
collaborate, share information or learn.
As chief, it was very, very important
that I would get activists into the
academy and show them how we train on
use of force. They became better
informed activists and they really
became partners with us so that they
could protest peacefully. We could do
our job safely and we had relationships
that worked. Those relationships aren't
existing in Minnesota and that is
horrible. Can you imagine any sort of
scenario where ICE Watch would be
willing to cooperate, communicate with
ICE? It seems that their uh effort is to
shut the organization down, to shut the
agency down.
&gt;&gt; If they truly wanted to have an impact
and make positive, proactive change,
they would build communicationbased
relationships. I know this because we
built a platform that allows law
enforcement to collaborate and share
sensitive information in encrypted
portal legally with these protest groups
and those agencies that do that don't
have these issues. So ICE watch could
work effectively with ICE. We have a
very steep hill to climb to start making
this relationship work, but there's
avenues for them to do this successfully
and start making proactive change that
keeps their members safe. You know, one
more question. There are a lot of people
that might want to be part of an
organization like Ice Watch, but they're
part of a different organization, an
organization that perhaps has a
different name for what they call the
people that are tracking ICE out on the
streets. And Ice Watch was using terms
like legal observer. I've heard
verifiers used before. Some
organizations say, you know, we go, we
take pictures, we stand back at least
seven feet. We let the agents know that
we're there. And but what about the
training of people that are really going
into dangerous situations uh where you
don't know who's being arrested, you
don't know where the situation will go
and you're standing 7 feet away, 10 feet
away shouting things at officers. Your
thoughts on any sort of training that
might be happening with these
organizations.
&gt;&gt; You know, you bring up an excellent
point. And I've talked about this for
over a decade now because anytime
there's a high-profile use of force
incident or a deadly force encounter,
the immediate reaction is we want all of
the training from that law enforcement
entity. But when there is fault, alleged
misconduct, or potential violations of
law of a protest or activism group,
where's their records of training? Where
is their professional accountability?
Where is their litigation that could be
filed against them because you didn't
train your members accordingly? they can
work with their local police departments
and learn about how we train and prepare
and become partners in this effort. We
want them to have peaceful protests. We
want to work with them. We just want
them to work with us so we can help them
train and learn more effectively on how
we mobilize and how we handle these
potentially violent incidents. And then
it's become a much safer incident and
there's teamwork involved
&gt;&gt; and that sounds like something that
could potentially save lives. Uh, we
greatly appreciate your insight this
morning. Former Fort Worth Chief of
Police Jeffrey Hollstead. Thank you very
