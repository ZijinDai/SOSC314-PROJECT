Garcia, what more do we know?
Yeah, I mean, basically,
Van Hollen went down to El Salva
trying to do
some of the constituent service
that we know that lawmakers
do all the time.
It's not always so high profile,
but this is exactly the kind of
where a U.S.
senator or congressman would get

So he flies down to El Salvador.
He meets with the vice president
of the country,
but he's unable
to access a meeting
directly with Abrego Garcia.
He says he's asked repeatedly
to have a phone call with him,
or for his family
to have a phone call with him.
Here's what he said happened
when he made that request.
I asked the vice president,
if I could meet with Mr.

not a lot of clarity on

to check on his well-being,
to find out how he's doing.

Ewg2we9qq-o,‘Chaos ensued’: Hear lawmaker’s experience about ICE clash outside Newark detention facility,20250511,CNN,110422,"The Department of Homeland Security accused three Democratic lawmakers of ‘storming’ an ICE facility despite oversight laws saying they could be there.
 
Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, who joined CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday alongside fellow New Jersey Democratic Reps. LaMonica McIver and Robert Menendez Jr., said the lawmakers haven’t heard from DHS after the tense encounter on Friday that culminated in the detention of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.

#CNN #News","The Trump
administration says
they may arrest
three Democratic lawmakers
after a chaotic scene
outside an ICE detention center
in New Jersey
that already led to the arrest
of Newark's mayor.
Those lawmakers are
under threat of arrest.
They are here with me now
you see them,
Democratic Congresswoman
Bonnie Watson Coleman,
Congresswoman LaMonica
McIver and Congressman
Rob Menendez.
Thanks to all three of you
for being here.
I'm going to start
with you, Congresswoman
Watson Coleman.
The Department of Homeland
Security spokeswoman was on CNN
and said
that potential charges
for all three of you
are, quote, on the table.
Have you heard
from anyone at DHS
that you might be charged
or arrested?
We've not heard anything.
We've only read what
everyone else has read.
we have no idea why
they would even suggest that.
Because we didn't do anything.
So,
no, we have no idea
what they have in mind
other than to,
create an environment
of intimidation
just by claiming that
perhaps we might be
subject to arrest.
But there's no reason for it.
Nothing happened
other than the chaos
that they created themselves.
if anything, we were pushed
and shoved, and
found in a very
vulnerable situation
for the three of us.
We went there to do
a legal oversight.
this it that we're allowed
to do,
permitted to do under the law.
And ICE delayed us,
tried to dissuade us.
disregarded us.
We were there
an hour and a half
before the mayor came, and,
we went out there to see
what was happening
when the mayor was there.
And then the mayor
was asked to leave the space,
and he left the state
willingly.
And the next thing we know,
ICE is going to arrest him.
And they arrested him
for trespassing
on public property,
which is absurd.
Congresswoman McIver,
I want to go back
to some of the footage
we were looking at at some,
And I want our viewers
to see that you, are the woman
in the red
blazer as we show them.
the DHS says that
obviously, that
there were chaos, that
maybe you were trespassing.
You can talk about that. But,
the DHS also says
that in their words,
you were body slamming
an ICE officer.
Is that what we're looking at?
Is that what happened?
absolutely. No.
I mean,
I honestly do
not know how to body
slam anyone.
there's no video
that supports me
body slamming anyone.
we as, Congresswoman
Bonnie Watson
Coleman said
we were simply there
to do our job.
therefore, oversight visit
and what you what
what you're watching
in the video
and we don't have
all of the body cam.
And we hope that
all of the body
cam is released.
it was a very tense situation.
it unfortunately
did not have to be like that.
They created
that confrontation.
They created that chaos.
and then ultimately
went to arrest the mayor
of the largest
city of New Jersey,
who is my mayor
and my constituent.
and it was very difficult
to watch that happen.
but I absolutely I did
not body slam anyone.
Congressman Menendez,
as we saw there,
there was a lot of shoving,
a lot of shouting going on.
It got physical.
How did this situation escalate
in the first place?
And is there anything
about what happened?
Looking back
and looking at that video that
you might regret
about how it played out?
Yeah, I appreciate that.
I think there's a lot
of opportunities
for DHS, for ICE
to de-escalate the situation.
They chose not to.
There's three
House members there.
The mayor of the largest city.
And as you can see
in all the video,
and this is important.
They had over 20
armed ICE HSI officers.
They were heavily armed.
They were there.
Their faces were covered
and they're wearing
no identification.
So this is who they chose
to have come.
engage with the mayor of Newark
and three elected members
of the House
of Representatives.
As, Congressman Watson
Coleman said
the mayor had gone on
to public property.
He had de-escalate
the situation.
We were all on
the other side of the fence.
the let's just call it
the private side of the fence.
The mayor was on
the public side.
Someone there
from HSI got a call.
And what happened next
was they reengaged
with the mayor.
They went on
to the public side,
and that's
where they arrested him.
So there were so many instances
where this could have
all been de-escalated,
but it was squarely inside
ICE's court.
They chose not to.
They made this a violent scene
that we were unfortunately,
all a part of.
And it's something
that should really shock
all Americans.
And this was an attempt.
you were doing a,
an event there, but you
were also trying to,
go forward
with part of your
job in Congress,
which is oversight.
Were you able to get any,
any of that oversight?
Actually done?
Congresswoman McIver,
I'll send that to you.
Yes, we actually were.
I mean, that's
why I find it to be appalling
that they said
we were trespassing.
Because how are we trespassing?
And then you offer us a tour.
at the end.
Which is the reason
why we were there
in the first place,
to have a tour of this facility
that had just opened up
on May 1st.
It had over 100 detainees.
We were getting reports
prior to our tour
that children were there.
We did not know
the status of the facility
or the status of the
of the detainees.
And so that is
why we showed up there
to do our job as members
and New Jerseyans
count on us to do our job.
Immigration has been something
that's in the back doors
in the backyards of New Jersey.
And it's it's our job
to make sure everything
is running
properly at this facility.
So we were able to get a tour.
towards the end of all of that
commotion, all of that chaos.
They took us on a tour,
offered us a soda.
in the midst of doing this.
Never apologized
or said anything about the
the confrontation
and the chaos
that they caused outside.
But we were able to get in,
speak to detainees,
check out the facilities.
and, you know, make sure
everything was okay there.
The tour. Congresswoman.
Watson Coleman,
just to be clear,
the tour came after
that confrontation.
The tour came after
the confrontation,
even though we were there
almost two hours
before the confrontation
took place.
But ICE kept giving us
the runaround
and kept saying
that they needed
to talk to someone else.
So finally,
when we saw that
all of the hierarchy
from ICE
in the state of New Jersey
was on the premises,
we were ready to
then do the, tour.
But then this ensued.
this conversation
that they had with the mayor.
We were right there
on the site with him
when they asked him
to get off of the property.
He willingly moved quietly move
with dignity and respect.
And then chaos ensued
when someone on the phone
above the,
leaders of ICE who were with us
at the facility instructed them
to go into go
out of the facility,
go to the private property,
and lock
the mayor
of the largest city
in the state up.
That's absurd.
That's un-American.
That's scary.
That's determination
to intimidate,
people in this country.
And we fear for the safety
and security
of everyday families
just trying to go
about their lives.
If they can do this to three
federally elected officials
with the authority
to come and do their job
and they can
then also lock up
the mayor of the largest city
in the state of New Jersey
who is on public property.
I understand
the fear
that I keep
getting information on
people just are afraid
of this un-American
hyper activity.
This weaponization
of law enforcement,
and the consistent
lying at all levels
to try to cover up
for the wrong
and the lawful activities
that I did on that day.
Lot of,
unanswered questions here.
Appreciate the three of you
coming on together, today
to try to shed
a little bit more light on it.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you so much
for having us."

Mayor Ras Baraka is responding
to new allegations by DHS
after being handcuffed
and arrested by ICE agents
at a protest
outside a facility.
Stop shoving.
Get off of me!
Don’t put your hands on me!
Department of Homeland
Security
says the mayor was trespassing
and ignored repeated warnings.
The mayor says he did
nothing wrong.
He was released from custody
Friday night.
And the Democratic
Mayor of Newark Ras Baraka
joining us right now.
All right.
I want to ask you
about something
that happened over the weekend.
DHS is accusing you
and members of Congress of,
quote, storming the facility.
And now DHS is saying
that more arrests are possible
because of what?
And I want you to listen to it.
DHS Assistant Secretary
Tricia McLaughlin
told our Victor Blackwell
this weekend. Take a listen.
There were multiple
people arrested.
And, Victor,
I think that we should let
viewers know
there will likely be more
arrests coming.
We actually have body
camera footage
of some of these
members of Congress
assaulting our Ice enforcement
officers, including body
slamming a female ice
off officer.
So we will be showing
that to viewers very shortly.
You see a video going to.
Members of Congress.
Body slamming ICE--
That's correct.
Officials? That's correct sir.
It's disgusting.
Or I'm curious
if you've heard
anything about this
or did
you witnessed this happening?
This is a complete fabrication.
I mean, either she wasn't there
and with
this was misinformed
or she's just
straight out line.
I mean, it's
all about an 80 year
old congresswoman.
another congresswoman
and Congressman Menendez,
they they grabbed, slammed
No one.
No one stormed
the place
there is a video,
first of all, is video
from all angles,
that reporters had,
as a matter of fact,
a news agency.
There's a video
that shows the beginning
of the incident
all the way to the end that,
folks have who were out there
taping and videotaping,
when this thing comes
completely out,
you'll see
how egregious these lies are.
nobody stormed anything.
Those folks,
when I got there,
they were already inside,
escorted inside,
by Geo
and ICE to a booth to wait
for Homeland Security folks to
come and give them a tour.
you know, so,
I sat in at
least over an hour waiting,
on the other
side of the gate for,
them to come out,
you know, with no,
discussion, no talk, no
one telling me to leave.
Nothing.
Zero,
and was let in, by the way.
So all this stuff is, is
is a fabrication,
a complete fabrication.
this officer was sent
to the special agent in charge.
Was sent there
specifically to arrest me.
Okay, so you said that
members of Congress
were let into the facility,
and they are
allowed to go into facilities
without prior arrangements.
that is, part of their duties.
you as the mayor
are not afforded that, right?
Why were you there?
And you said that
there were no issues before.
What happened?
How did this
get really riled up with?
You ended up being
in handcuffs, being,
you know, arrested.
It's clear if you seen a video,
they rounded up the escalate.
I was there because,
you know, ultimately
we have a dispute with Geo.
I was I've been there
every single day
in the morning, every day.
serving them
with the fire inspector
and a health inspector,
the UCC inspectors.
We’re in dispute in court.
serving them,
because they won’t allow
the fire inspectors entry
into the property
to do their inspections
for certificate of occupancy.
They won't allow them in.
we go to every day
to serve them.
I was there that morning.
I was called back to come down
for a press conference
that the congresspeople
were having
as they viewed,
the inside
so they could tell us
about what was going on.
And I was going to participate
in that press conference.
That's why I was there.
and I have a right to be there.
I'm the mayor of
the city of Newark.
I have a right to make sure
that people
are following
the rules, our laws,
and that there's transparency,
especially in a private,
facility like this.
So I came down here for that
purpose only.
the special agent
in charge came there,
escalated that situation,
and I'm sure he escalated it
because he was told to,
and and
and they came directly for me
and this lie about more
people were arrested.
That's not true.
It was only one person
arrested that day,
and that was me.
No one else was arrested.
No one else, was in the car.
No one else was in cuffs.
No one else
sat in the ICE
detention facility or Homeland
Security's detention facility.
But me, that's it.
That no other protest
or no protest was there?
No congresspeople,
no elected officials,
no bystanders. Just me.
Do you worry at
all, mayor,
about
when you look at
some of the numbers,
when people are polled
and they tend to agree with,
some of what
the administration is doing
when it comes to how it is,
are trying to get,
you know, immigrants
who are here undocumented,
out of the country.
Are you worried
about the optics here
at all for Democrats?
when you look at the way
in which people are seeing,
the immigration fight go down.
I'm worried about the erosion
of the Constitution
of the United States.
Erosion of democracy.
It's authoritarianism
that's coming here.
and if the polls look like that
is because
people are controlling
the conversation,
and we're allowing them
to we're making them
believe that
the only people
that they're attacking
are gang
members, child rapist,
murderers, that
they keep saying over
and over and over again,
they're not talking
about people,
that they have green cards.
Would have theses
that they're
kidnaping off the street,
or individuals
that are, in fact,
citizens of the United States
and get caught up,
into this mayhem,
or individuals who are waiting,
for the process to be finished.
That could be 6 or 7 years.
We've already tried
to become citizens
and are waiting
for that process
when they make a decision
not to allow
to go through that process,
and they grab them
and deport them
and separate them
from their families.
These are more of those people
than the more of the others
that you're talking about.
And so
when that
when we begin
talking about that
and changing the dialog,
to that, then people
begin to understand
what's really happening here,
the erosion
of the Fourth Amendment,
of due process of the Fifth
Amendment, of the 14th Amendment
if we could disagree
on immigration,
until we blue in the face,
we can disagree on
what the process should be,
what our policy should be,
but we can't disagree
on the Constitution
of the United States
on the Fourth Amendment of due
process, that anybody on
this soil
has the right to due process.
That's what
separates America
from any other country
in the world.
Mayor,
thank you so much for coming
on, and we'll be
checking back in with you,
to see
when the DHS says
they're going
to release all the tapes
and show some of this evidence
that you say is hogwash.
I really appreciate
you coming on.
There was a pretty
ugly incident on Friday
with the Democratic
mayor of Newark,
Ras Baraka, was arrested
as he was protesting
the opening
of a federal immigration
detention center in New Jersey.
And there was an altercation
involving three
Democratic members of Congress
and Ice agents.
And there's a suggestion,
even by a homeland
security spokeswoman,
that the members themselves
may face some charges.
So, Congressman,
I'm wondering
if you think
this type of incident
is helpful for your party
as you try to regain voters
that you lost, particularly
on an issue like immigration?
I actually think that voters
don't like
what they're seeing
in terms of ICE and DHS.
you know, engaging
in these incidents
where they're threatening
to arrest members of Congress
for conducting oversight
and then kind of making up,
charges that somehow,
you know,
these members were assaulting
Ice agents
when the video shows
exactly the opposite.
I think that, Donald Trump and,
you know, his cronies right now
are rocking, people's, sense
of what
the rule of law should be,
in a way
that makes them feel very,
very upset.
when a four year old
American citizen child
with cancer is deported
without due process, it
shocks the conscience.
And Americans don't like that,
and they want something
very, very different.
and they want to get
their country back.
So you guys just said
you don't think those members
of Congress, as Democrats,
should have handled that
situation any differently?
Well, if you see the
video,
they were coming in
to conduct oversight
and you have a
bunch of ICE officers
who are manhandling them.
and I think they were doing
what they had to do,
especially when
the Newark mayor was arrested.
for, you know, visiting this
ICE facility.
Let's just be clear.
The message here is,
they're trying to send to
others is don't,
do any oversight
of our administration
and certainly don't
criticize us.
Yeah,
there seems to be
a lot of questions
about exactly what
happened there."
7kYT2RgCfKM,Bodycam video shows residents trying to stop ICE agents from arresting woman,20250517,CNN,107612,"Residents in Worcester, Massachusetts can be seen in local police bodycam footage trying to stop the arrest of a woman by ICE in early May, some residents even using their bodies to physically block the agent's vehicle. #CNN #News","Fallout, now in
Worcester, Massachusetts,
following the chaotic
ICE arrest
of a woman last week.
Worcester police
are now releasing
dramatic police body cam
video of the incident.
Stop, stop, stop!
What you see here.
Neighbors and a family member
trying to stop ICE
agents from arresting
the woman.
Worcester officials
say after considering the chaos
that erupted
there, now exploring
how their employees,
including police,
should interact
with federal immigration
agents.
CNN's Gloria Pazmino
is following all of this.
Gloria, help
put all of this into context
for us.
Yeah, right.
And that's important
because what we're seeing here
is essentially a municipality
that is struggling with what
to do
when federal law enforcement
agents show up in its town
to enforce immigration law.
And that's exactly what
we were seeing here.
You had ICE enforcement
show up to Worcester,
Massachusetts,
to arrest a woman.
And it was during that attempt
that chaos erupted,
as you can see in the video.
Now, the city has released
a video in part
to try and get some clarity
about exactly
what happened here.
Now, let me explain
what you're looking at here.
There was a woman in a house
in Worcester,
Massachusetts, taking
care of an infant
and a 16 year old.
Ice showed up.
She called the 16
year old's mother
to come and help.
As it turns out, ICE
was there to arrest
the mother of the 16 year old
when they moved
in to arrest her.
The 16 year old
tried to block the ICE officers
from being able to take her.
It turns out that
that was the teenager's
mother who they were
trying to arrest.
Now it gets really chaotic
here, where she is
holding an infant.
You can see it there
and she is standing
in front of a police vehicle
in an attempt to block it.
And this is where
things really begin
to fall apart, right?
Because they are blocking
this police video.
They're holding
an infant in their arms,
putting that child in danger.
And now you have
immigration officers
who are trying
to make an arrest.
And local police
who are trying to keep
things under control.
There's a lot of people
surrounding the officers.
People are chanting,
do not take the mother again.
That the woman
that ICE is there to arrest.
and so this is a really
chaotic situation
and that's why
local police responded.
Now, the 16
year old was eventually,
arrested and charged.
You can
see there
that she's holding the infant,
along with another woman
who was also charged
with assault
and battery
on a police officer,
among other charges.
Now, we are told
that the woman who was,
going to be arrested by ICE,
According to DHS,
she had been previously
arrested by local police
for assault and battery
with a dangerous weapon
and assault and battery
on a pregnant, victim.
That's who they were
there to arrest.
Now, as I said,
the city of Worcester
tried to release this video
in order to bring clarity
to what happened here.
And here's
what the city manager
had to say in part, quote,
So the city manager,
there, acknowledging that
there's only so much
they can do
in a situation like this
where it becomes so chaotic,
where you have both the public
and law enforcement officers
potentially in danger.
The local police
had to step in.
All right.
Gloria Pazmino,
thank you so much for that.
All right.
The U.S.
Supreme Court has blocked
the Trump administration
from moving forward
with deportations
under the 1798 Alien Enemies
Act, a sweeping
wartime authority.
Friday's ruling
from the nation's
top court applies
to a group
of Venezuelan immigrants
in northern Texas.
The justices sent the case
back to an appeals court
to decide
other underlying questions,
including whether
the president's move is legal.
President Trump
lashed out
at the ruling on social media,
writing, quote,
The Supreme Court
won't allow us to get criminals
out of our country, unquote.
All right.
Joining me right now
with more
on all of this,
the impact of this ruling,
Jeffrey Jacobovitz,
he is an adjunct law professor
at the Washington
College of Law
at American University.
He's also a trial attorney.
Great to see you, Jeffrey.
So I see you.
All right.
Help us understand
the significance
of this ruling.
Did the role,
you know, at all
on the legality of using
the Alien Enemies Act or
instead deferred
it to a lower court?
No.
What they did really is
defer to a lower court.
And they didn't say
you cannot do it,
but they said
that these deportees
are entitled to due process,
and you can't just pick them up
and take them out
of the country.
you need to have hearings
pursuant to the Fifth
Amendment and,
this hasn't been happening.
And so the court decision is,
once again
against the Trump
administration
on an immigration matter.
So now this will mean
due process
to anyone moving forward.
But how about retroactively?
for those
who have been deported
or are about to be processed
and be deported.
if they have not been given
due process,
will that now
have to be extended
according to this ruling?
Well, that's
a very good question, Fred,
because the issue will be,
will the Trump administration
follow this ruling?
And they have not followed
some of the rulings,
they have followed others.
And, for example, Judge
Boasberg asked them
to bring the planes back
or stop the planes.
And the Trump
administration did not do that.
So you have people already
who who have been taken
out of the country
and are in El Salvador.
The court is saying
you cannot do that.
The court is saying
you need to have hearings first
to legitimize it and
obviously, I think
lower courts will rule
that these people
have to be brought back
once,
their lawyers
file for hearings.
the question
is, will they do it?
Will the Trump administration
do it? Okay.
And you just underscore
it already,
the Trump
administration has defied
at least one order or two.
So then what happens
if this continues
to be a pattern
of defying a court order,
no matter what
level of court it is?
Well, Judge
Boasberg already started
looking at contempt
proceedings against,
DOJ officials or others,
and the D.C.
circuit put a hold to it.
But now we have a Supreme
Court decision
which is clear cut,
that there has to
be due process.
We have judge in us
who was asked,
the administration
to bring somebody back.
They haven't done it.
And so
the only way
you can really rectify
it is to hold
people in contempt.
But it doesn't mean
that ultimately,
it will happen,
because if you hold somebody
in contempt,
Trump can pardon them.
but he wouldn't or couldn't
pardon them
until the end of the year.
But so in the duration or
in the midst of it.
All right.
Now, what would contempt
actually look like
for any of these parties
who would
be disrespectful of an order?
Sure,
there can be civil contempt
or criminal contempt.
generally criminal contempt
you have to, refer
for refer over
to the Department of Justice
and Attorney General Bondi
hasn't shown any inclination
to hold people in contempt.
So if it's civil contempt,
you can find people.
And it could be,
you know,
a big fine,
it could be smaller, fine.
But, that is one way to do it.
And the contempt proceedings,
could impact
on, for example, a DOJ
attorney, a DOJ attorneys
ability to practice
before the bar in DC,
Have the muscles
of the judicial system
ever been stretched
like this before?
From what you can recall?
Well,
there have been stretches,
but this is pretty,
blatant and direct and,
even statements
by the administration about.
Well, they
they will likely follow,
most of the decisions
or something along
those lines
is somewhat surprising.
and we're in
new territory here.
And,
and whether they will follow
it is really a $64,000
question. All right.
Jeffrey Jacobovitz,
it's always great to see you.
Thanks so much. Thank you, Fred."
VnhGeqoypjc,CNN speaks with Georgia teen freed after weeks in ICE custody,20250528,CNN,142633,"The Georgia college student who was arrested during a traffic stop and detained by ICE after those charges were dropped has been released from custody. 

Ximena Arias Cristobal spoke with CNN's Boris Sanchez.  #CNN #News","New today.
Key Trump administration
officials reportedly
want to ramp up the pace
of his immigration
crackdown to 3000 arrests
per day,
sources telling Axios
that during a tense
meeting last week,
Stephen Miller
and HHS Secretary Kristi
Noem demanded that
agents triple
the number of daily arrests
that they were making,
despite recent border
crossing numbers plummeting.
Immigration
advocates are warning
that this push could lead
to more wrongful detentions
and also
the deportation of undocumented
immigrants
with no criminal record
who have lived
in the United States for years
and who are otherwise
contributing members
of their communities.
One such
case has made headlines
in Georgia,
where a college student
who was wrongfully pulled over
wound up
detained by ICE for weeks
over her undocumented status.
Ximena Arias Cristobal
is now out on bond,
and she's
speaking out
after she was accused
of making an improper turn
and lacking a driver's license
earlier this month in Dalton,
and she was arrested
following a review of dash
cam footage.
Though police determined
that, quote
the citations against
her were dropped,
but the 19 year old
remained in detention
for two weeks
because of her legal status.
Coincidentally
in the same detention center
as her father,
who is also undocumented.
Both were later
released on bond
and then reunited
with their family.
But where things go
from here is uncertain.
Born in Mexico,
Ximena
came to the United States
with her parents
at four years old.
Her attorneys are now
exploring options
for her to stay in the country,
including an investigation
they hope could lead to
what's known as a U visa,
a type of visa set aside
False imprisonment,
we should point out,
is listed as one qualifying
criminal activity.
We're joined now
live by Ximena Arias
Cristobal,
thank you so much
for being with us, Ximena.
First and foremost, just
how are you doing
through all this?
I'm doing
okay through
everything, but it's hard.
And I understand that
you are scared, in part
to leave your home.
I wonder what advice
your attorneys have given you
about what you should be doing.
Your activities
as these proceedings
play out in court.
they've advised me to stay.
At home as much as I can.
And if.
I do go out because. They know.
Some people have to go out
at times to be very careful
and just be very cautious
of my surroundings.
And know that not everybody.
Has a best interest.
Yeah.
I want to kind of step back
and get a better
understanding for
the circumstances
in which you find yourself in.
When did you first learn
that you were undocumented?
I think I was around.
It was very early.
On, I was probably around 6 or 7
My parents. Made it very clear.
And ever since then I've known.
Had they taken steps
prior to all of this
to attain legal status?
Had that been
something ongoing?
Yes it was.
I know a lot of people.
Think we've been here 15.
Years.
We had enough time
to obtain citizenship, but
to be honest, it's
very, very hard to obtain
citizenship or residency.
We tried various times.
We hired a lawyer
after lawyer asking,
what's the pathway
to citizenship residency.
Or a permit?
And they just.
Told us, you have to wait for.
Something to change.
Or you have to wait for.
Ximena to get older and.
Get married or have U.S.
citizen. Children.
There was never.
A clear path for us.
and I just want to make sure.
Have you ever been
arrested before?
Had you ever been accused
or charged of any crime?
No.
Absolutely not.
I had never been in any type.
Of problem. Anywhere.
So what do you say
to the Trump administration
and those who argue that
by simply being here,
you're breaking the law?
I'm, my family and I
were aware
that we broke the law
by being here
without the
proper documentation,
but I think
we tried to take the steps
to do so.
And the system
didn't really allow us to.
So I would just tell them
to be
a little bit understanding,
be a little bit
compassionate towards people.
In my.
Situation who truly.
Don't have a criminal record.
Who are working,
who are
a great example of
what a citizen
should look like.
They should.
Give us an opportunity.
And find a way
for us to be able to be here
legally.
I remember
watching the dash cam video,
of your arrest.
It was, startling for you.
I could tell
because at one point
when the officer said
that you were under arrest,
you responded with that
you couldn't miss final exams.
You're majoring,
I understand, in finance
at Dalton State
where you earned
scholarships to attend.
I wonder with that in context,
what would it mean
for your future
to be deported and
to return to Mexico?
I'm not.
100.
Percent sure,
but it would be very hard
for me
to start college in Mexico.
Although I am.
Fluent in Spanish and I'm able.
To read it,
it'll be very difficult
having to. Write and.
Just go into college
where it's. For Spanish.
And
I just think it'll be very hard
to be able to take.
That up again
if I was in Mexico.
And have you made
any contingency plans
in case you do get deported?
Do you have any family
or a support system there,
or would you essentially
be moving to a place that
you don't really know?
Essentially, I would be moving
to a place I don't really know.
Although I do have.
Family in Mexico.
It's not family
that I'm close to,
so most of them I haven't met.
So I.
Would be moving. To a.
Place I'm not familiar with.
I understand
that your attorneys
are now investigating
your arrest, in the hopes
that it could help you
obtain this U visa,
which is meant for crime
victims.
You know, a
skeptical person
might say that
people get pulled
over by mistake all the time.
I wonder why you think it is
that would happen to you
qualifies as a crime.
I'm not 100 per.
I couldn't really speak.
On that because I'm not.
Very educated. On. That topic.
But it
just because it was a false
arrest. And.
They did pull over the wrong
vehicle, it.
Falls into the. Category.
So
fortunately for me
and my family.
If that is the step
we can take,
then it will be best for us.
But I'm not quite sure.
I can't really.
Speak on it as much
because I'm not really. Sure.
I understood.
I do wonder what it's like
to be
in your community right now,
because I know that 70%
of Whitfield County,
where you're from,
voted for President Trump,
and also about one third
of the people in your community
are immigrants.
Many of them,
I imagine,
in similar circumstances,
not having papers.
Do you see the community
as having changed
since all of this happened?
What have you heard from
folks around you? Neighbors?
I do,
we have a lot of
friends around here,
and we've just heard that
Hispanics are taking
a lot more precaution.
Being out and just being a lot.
Safer with what they're doing.
As for
people that voted for Trump.
I think my situation.
In some way open
some of their eyes because.
I think whenever they.
Voted for Trump,
they thought, okay.
We're going to get all
the criminals. Out.
And then they.
See that I got arrested.
Somebody
that was in college
volunteered.
Here in the community.
And they they saw
what had happened to me.
And it kind of made them.
feel a different way towards
them voting.
For Trump.
And humanity.
There's an untold people.
There's an untold
number of people,
I should say, in this country
that are in
your same situation.
They're young people who fear
they may be deported
despite having
built their lives
in the United States.
What would you say
to those folks?
I'd say
to be very cautious with
how they go about
their everyday life,
but I would also.
Want them to know that.
That piece of.
Document doesn't.
Define them as a person,
and that with the voice I.
Have right now.
going to try
to spread awareness
about the situation
a lot of people face.
And hopefully
there's some kind of.
Movement in.
The. System that can help.
People like us who really are.
Contributing
to the United States
and not breaking any laws.
Ximena Arias-Cristobal,
we are so grateful
that, you've shared
your story with us,
please keep us posted on
what comes next
and we wish you good luck.
All right.
Well, thank you so much
for having me. Of course."
z0jPhtas0E4,Georgia teen detained by ICE gets support from GOP lawmaker,20250531,CNN,50573,"Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old college student, was mistakenly pulled over while driving in Dalton, Georgia on May 5. Her arrest led to a federal immigration hold and ICE to detain Arias for more than two weeks.

Republican state representative Kasey Carpenter wrote a letter calling for Arias’ release and for Congress to overhaul the immigration system. CNN’s Victor Blackwell speaks with Ximena Arias Cristobal and Rep. Kasey Carpenter.

Dalton Police later said a review of dashcam video showed the officer pulled over the wrong truck and that Arias was not the driver who made the illegal turn. The department dropped all traffic charges against her.. #CNN #News","President Trump has always
been clear
that he wants to crack down
on illegal immigration.
But are his
administration's actions
going beyond what he promised?
So let me play this for you.
This is what President-
Elect Trump told
NBC's Kristen Welker.
This is right
before the start
of the second term.
I just want to make sure
I'm clear,
which is that
you're saying, yes,
you're going to
focus on the people
with criminal histories,
but everyone who's here
illegally has to go.
I'm saying this
we have to
get the criminals
out of our country.
One of Donald Trump's
first executive orders
promised to crack down
on illegal immigrants
and criminals.
Specifically,
anyone threatening the safety
or security
of the American people.
But those are not
the only people being targeted
now that the promise is policy.
There are also people
like Carol Mayorga.
She's a mother of three
who's lived in rural Missouri
for almost 20 years.
And according to NPR's
Saint Louis station,
Mayorga was arrested
and shackled
when she tried to renew her
employment
authorization document.
A customer
at the breakfast joint
where she works at every day
told the
station this about her arrest
and possible deportation.
95% of the people here
support Donald Trump.
I do too, but this is wrong.
There's also the case of Dylan.
He's 20 years old,
from Venezuela.
No criminal record.
According to a teacher's union.
He was
detained in New
York after a judge dismissed
his immigration proceedings.
Protests have since broken out
over his arrest.
Those are just two of the cases
that surfaced this week alone.
And now their communities
are rallying around them.
They're protesting.
They're holding fundraisers
for legal fees.
Neighbors are speaking out
as character witnesses,
even if they voted
for the very administration
carrying out these efforts.
A similar story
has been playing out
in a small town in Georgia.
19 year old Xmena
Arias
Cristobal was wrongfully
pulled over in Dalton
earlier this month.
Now, Dalton police admit
the arrest was a mistake.
She was detained for two
and a half weeks
by federal authorities.
Ximena is now
out of ICE detention.
in her corner
has been a Republican
state lawmaker,
Representative
Kasey Carpenter.
He wrote a letter
advocating for her release,
calling her a person
of high moral character.
And he has launched a petition
asking Congress to overhaul
the immigration system.
The state
representative, Kasey
Carpenter and Ximena
Arias Cristobal
are both with me now.
Thank you for being here.
And Representative Carpenter,
let me start with you.
What is it about
Ximena’s story
that compelled you to
to write this statement
as a character
witness
and do more
than, at the very least,
stay silent?
the reality is,
that's not the first letter
that I've had to write.
I live in a very diverse
community, and unfortunately,
we've had a lot of folks
that have been, detained
for us.
Ximena struck and struck
a chord among our community.
Got a huge
outpouring of support.
But for me personally,
you know, we
we have friends
that know each other.
We attend the same church.
we attended
the same high school.
She goes to Dalton State.
Just a great, great kid
with a bright, bright future.
And I thought
it was an easy letter to write
with to support
this young lady.
Ximena,
Did you expect
at the start
of the administration that,
you would have to be
on heightened alert,
considering
the characterization of what
the president said
would be his priority?
Those who threaten
safety of communities.
Yeah.
Do not think so.
It never crossed my mind.
since he did say he was going
to get all the criminals
and I didn't fall into that
category.
you've been released
from ICE detention,
but you could
still be deported.
you left Mexico when you were.
How old?
Four year old.
And do you have any connection
to to Mexico?
Or know what would happen
or where you go
if you were deported?
So, you know,
I know I have family in Mexico,
but I don't really know them.
So it would be very hard to
go to Mexico and start fresh,
you know.
Representative Carpenter
there are Republican
members of Congress
who are saying
the Venezuelans
in Florida who have temporary
protected status.
and really, across the country,
in some of these
countries, these,
people who've come
here during
the Biden
administration
that they are law abiding,
that they are
members of the community,
and they don't fit
the profile of the promise
from the president.
Why is this now
spreading to
raids of restaurants,
arresting college students?
Why do you think
that has become
part of the priority
from the administration?
I don't know that
it's necessarily
a priority
of the administration.
I think, unfortunately,
if you don't clarify
with law enforcement
who they're supposed to detain,
they have to detain everybody.
Yeah.
You know,
in the state of Georgia,
if you get caught jaywalking
and you don't
have legal status,
they have to detain you.
We have to develop a system
that says,
you know,
these people
are really a danger to society.
Detain these people.
There's not enough funds
to to
to run all these people
out of the country.
And so let's focus on the
it's like triage, right?
You don't
the guy comes in
with a headache,
you don't address him.
The guy's bleeding.
That's been shot.
That's the guy you address.
Same with the immigration.
We have to focus on the people
that are a danger to society
and to Americans.
I went back and read the, roll
call of the vote
for the Georgia Criminal Alien
Track and Report
Act last year,
which requires
local law enforcement
to cooperate,
with, ICE,
and transfer
undocumented immigrants.
You were the only Republican
in the legislature, House or
Senate to vote against it.
considering what we've
seen,
if it were to
come up for a vote again today,
you think you'd be alone
in the legislature
as the only Republican?
I hope not.
You know, this
that, that bill
kind of got fast tracked
after the horrific incident
in Athens. with Laken Riley.
And it got fast tracked
through the legislature.
I think if people
would sit back now
and see what
the consequences are,
because I've had
calls from my colleagues
across the state
that have experienced
what I've experienced.
Kids that are leaving
graduation,
that are in a fender bender,
and then they get detained
and miss graduation.
Good kids, good families.
And so I think I would
hope they would at least
take a pause and say,
let's change
the language
of this legislation
and let's focus on
hardened criminals,
because nobody wants
criminals here.
I think that 90% of Americans
don't want that.
But I think
the majority of Americans
would appreciate a pathway
for people that have been here
and not committed crimes
for 20 years.
Ximena, I read that you said,
despite,
you know, you
not being
violent or one of the criminals
that that
the president said that,
he would prioritize
when you were in custody,
you felt like
you were being treated
like one of, quote,
one of the worst
criminals ever.
How so?
At the detention center.
You're deprived
of a lot of your human rights.
And so it
it makes you feel like
you're a criminal
and a detention center there.
It's not supposed to be a place
where you're treated
like a criminal.
It's to detain you
till you figure out your
legal status.
But instead, you're treated
as if you were in a prison.
How is life for you now?
It's difficult.
having to go
my my, my every day life.
It's changed a lot.
And I can't go
back to my regular life.
and, Representative Carpenter,
what are you asking for?
from Washington,
from the administration,
but also from Congress. Sure.
Just get off their duff. Right?
I mean, we've been dealing
with this issue
for 40, 50 years.
Reagan
did a lot back in his day,
but then they didn't
secure the borders.
And I think
you have to attack it
for pronged approach.
You have to secure the border.
You have to get rid of the bad
guys.
You need to give people pathway
that have been here for 20
plus years.
And then you also need
to speed up the process
for others
to come in the country.
Private industry
needs employees.
If we're going to have tariffs
that bring business
back to the United States,
we're going to need workers.
So we need an efficient system
for visas, etc.
if you do all that at once,
a nice across
the board approach,
then you have a solution.
But just picking
depending on
who's in power is dangerous.
And these people
become voluble.
But you acknowledge it
in this climate
especially, that is
I hate to say never,
but it's highly,
highly unlikely
that legislation
like that
is going to get through
Congress into the president.
I don't
I mean, I don't know,
the president
has been open about,
you know, making DACA permanent
and extending it to people
adding years to it.
He talked about that
in his first term.
There was a bill on the table,
and Pelosi wouldn't
allow it to go through House
because it
had funding for the wall.
So if everybody can get
rid of who's going to win
and who's
going to lose on issues
and allow everybody
to get a win.
I think the American people
would appreciate it.
Representative Carpenter and,
Ximena Arias Cristobal,
thank you both for being
with me this morning."

The suspected attacker, Mohamed Soliman, has a wife and five children, according to court filings. #CNN #News","Sources tell
CNN that the
family of the suspect
in the

because we know from reporting
that the family

They went

and turned it over.
We also know that the FBI,

during the press conference

So to put the family in custody
at this point,
if that's been done purely
for immigration reasons,
it's a bit of an odd move, to be
As an investigator,
if you have a cooperative family
that's providing information
about your attacker,
you might want to really work wi
and not threaten their cooperati

You can always do that later.

if they were willing to testify
about things
they heard the attackers
say or preparations
they saw him embark upon
things like that.
They can give you a context
for how he became radicalized.
So by putting them in custody,
you definitely take the chance
that they are no longer
in a position to cooperate
and you might cut off
that stream of information.
That's the one thing
that really kind
of catches my eye about it
as an investigator.
Yeah, it's a really interesting
way to to think about it. Yeah.
in terms of I mean, one thing
that we've seen the Trump
administration do in cases of st

that could have been used here?
It's certainly possible.

the way that the frequency
with which that's been done
in the last few months,
it's hard for me to say exactly

they would pin an action like th

I think, probably more likely
that the family members

that this arrest
was really more of a statement a

is with immigration. Enforce men
we know that the administration
is really putting
a ton of pressure on ice and oth
cooperating agencies to
to pump up the numbers of people
who have been taken into custody
This is very high profile
that I'm sure
that put this family on ICE's ra
in a way they probably
weren't before this.
so, you know, it may have
been a target of opportunity.
We'll see
as it plays out
if that's a good thing
or a bad thing for this case
and for the many people
in the Jewish community
who are, very, I'm
sure, focused on making sure
that this prosecution is success
Elliot Williams,
can I ask you about this
from a legal, perspective?
I mean, and you heard, of course
what,
Mr.
McCabe had to say
about the investigation.
You as a prosecutor,
how do you look at it?
Oh, I think this is another one
where the political
and legal realities may not line
certainly.
There's probably strong public i
in immigration action
being taken against the folks.
But as we've seen,
over these last months,
sometimes immigration actions
trigger legal challenges.
Now I understand
now, again,
we're just getting information a
that they're seeking
to get them out of the country
via expedited removal.
And depending on what's in the b
in the background that they're f
that may or may not be a basis
for doing so.
So number one, like was there
fraud in their applications

Is there

No because I've been here
for quite some time.
So there are some questions
that need to be asked.

There are reasons why
people are going to want them re

this they
they are using the Trump
administration is using the powe
they have in new ways.
Absolutely.
And I mean, what we've seen here
of course, a political calculati
The first comments that Presiden
made yesterday
in regards to
this attack was attacking,
you know, Biden's
immigration policy
and sort of attributing this
to Biden's immigration
policy, as we were still waiting
for more details
and continue to wait
for more details here.
So there's certainly
a political calculation here,
because this attack ties
back to the broader message
that President Trump
had on the campaign trail about,
you know, his promise
to deport criminals,
to deport people in the country
that, you know,
were committing acts of terror.
So this sort of ties
neatly into that message for him
especially at a time
where we're seeing more headline
you know, him
deporting people and local commu
that were family members,
parts of the community.
So this sort of gets to tie
back to that message
from the campaign,
and you might have a better basi
for getting them out of the coun
by simply following
established procedures
than by testing
the boundaries of the law,
because if you test the boundari
you might end up tied up in liti

Okay.
director McCabe,
I just want to end
on sort of the bigger
picture here, beyond what's goin
just with these family members.
The DHS put out an intelligence

So yesterday,

they remain concerned that succe

and their supporters

how common is it
for people to see something like

and then start to make their own
plans to try to do something?
Casey, there's no
question that
the inspiration factor is high h
We've already seen, the,

eltxxVi3FZI,Family of Colorado attack suspect taken into ICE custody,20250603,CNN,40445,"The family of the Egyptian national charged with attempted murder after an antisemitic Molotov cocktail attack in Colorado has been taken into ICE custody and are being processed, a DHS official confirmed to CNN Tuesday. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez reports. #CNN #News","We start this hour with new details
just in to CNN
and that horrific
firebombing attack in Boulder, Colorado,
on a peaceful event
highlighting Israeli hostages in Gaza.
Sources say that Ice officials
have now taken the suspect's wife
and five children into custody,
and they're now being processed.
Today, the suspect is being held
on $10 million cash bond.
He's been charged
with a federal hate crime
and multiple state charges as well,
including 16 counts of attempted murder.
Let's get straight
to CNN's Priscila
Alvarez for more on that
report that we've learned
that his family has now been detained.
Tell us what happened.
Yeah.
All these details are just now coming in
that his family, his wife
and his five
children have been taken into Immigration
and Customs Enforcement custody.
Now, the big question in all of this is
what is the legal status of his family,
given that we know that
he was a visa overstay
who applied for asylum,
who later fell out of status
with his work permit?
So we're still gathering those details
as well as the ages of his children.
We know, for example, as well
from some of these filings
that he does have a daughter
that graduated high school.
That is what, according to these filings,
he had not done the attack,
executed the attack earlier.
But again, the ages and the legal status
are still outstanding questions here.
But as a reminder,
as far as his immigration status,
two big points
in his immigration history, one,
that he arrived in 2022 on a visa
that is a visa that has been for tourism.
And when someone comes on a visa,
they can stay in the United States
for six months.
That is generally the limit.
But while he was on that visa,
he also applied for asylum
and he received later
a work permit
that expired in March of 2023.
So during that period,
he was illegally present
in the United States.
But this is a bit of a patchwork
immigration history,
which can actually be quite common.
A large number of visa overstayers
in the United States,
many of whom also apply
for different forms of immigration relief
when they are here.
So we are asking our sources
to see
whether his family
was in a similar situation
and what this portends for them
moving forward.
Priscilla Alvarez,
thank you so much for the latest there.
We're joined now
by former senior FBI profiler
Mary Ellen O'Toole.
She's now
the director of the forensic
science program
at George Mason University.
Mary, thank you so much for joining us.
According to the warrant,
the suspect said that no one else
had known about this attack,
and yet he had been planning it
for a year.
How do investigators
go about determining
whether there were signs
that he was planning this?
If anyone else may have
noticed or misread flags.
That's a great question.
And one of the things that we look for
immediately are
what were the warning behaviors,
which generally
take place days
or a few weeks
before an incident like this?
So what FBI agents and law enforcement
will be doing is going back
in his social media
to see who he communicates with,
who he had contacts with
maybe one on one contacts in person,
but they'll be looking for that
kind of of connection with other people,
but they'll also be looking for,
kind of strange behaviors.
One of the things that we've seen
frequently, recently is that
domestic violence is oftentimes,
one of those warning behaviors
because the individual knows
what they're going to do,
and they're thinking about it,
and they've made this final decision
that could even end up
in their own death,
or the repercussions could be enormous.
And so it's usually family members
that are close to the person
that hears them
talk about how they hate
certain groups of people
and so on and so forth.
And then you have domestic violence.
So but if the family doesn't report that,
then law enforcement is not, aware of it.
I am curious to get your perspective
on his level of premeditation,
because as we just heard
from Priscilla, the suspect,
according to filings, waited
until his daughter
graduated high school
to attack a group
that he had been researching online.
He chose to make this
makeshift flamethrower
and these Molotov cocktails
when he couldn't get access to a gun.
What does that tell you about his intent?
Well, the intent was definitely there,
but he's not a very good planner.
Now, it was effective, that's for sure.
So I. The two can't be, conflated.
But
what he did was he got
kind of makeshift items
that enabled him
to carry out this attack.
Fortunately, it did not kill anyone.
And the number of victims
has been somewhat limited.
So it it's really a plan that
that he sort of cobbled together,
in order to allow him to,
to carry something out.
But it does show that
this is probably someone
who doesn't
do a very good job of planning,
even in his everyday life.
notably, he told officials,
according to filings,
that he was planning to die
during the attack.
He then surrendered
after throwing two fire bombs.
What might explain that shift?
It could be a
shift, but it also could be,
trying to sort of develop
or create some kind of,
sympathy from other people,
as in other words, saying, well,
I was prepared to die for this,
and I was prepared to lose my family.
So it's it could be an effort to, develop
some kind of sympathy
on the part of the investigators.
And that's still not known,
but it doesn't necessarily mean that
he fully intended to die in that attack.
And it was just by happenstance
that he didn't.
Other
some offenders will say that to you,
because after the event,
they want to develop the
the sympathy of the investigators
with the hope
that maybe
they can minimize
the impact on themselves
or even on their family.
That is so fascinating.
He has now been charged
with attempted murder
and with a federal hate crime as well.
But he's not facing terrorism charges.
And,
convicting
someone of terroristic acts.
that it carries a lot of prerequisites
that investigators
perhaps don't feel that they have here.
What would they need to do that?
What additional evidence
would they need to file
those kinds of charges?
Well, it's
really going to be more
on the state level,
because right now
there are no federal charges
that would equate to them
being able for the federal prosecutor
to be able to charge him with terrorist,
federal terrorism.
But what they can do
is that
once he is convicted
of these multiple charges
that are pending against him,
including hate crimes,
and that really does involve
a pretty severe sentence.
They can always add on
to the sentence and, and,
and bring to the attention of the court
that this really was an act of terrorism,
but for the fact that they don't have
a specific,
federal law
that allowed them to charge him,
they still want that to be taken
into consideration for the sentencing.
Mary Ellen O'Toole,
thank you so much
for sharing your expertise.
We're learning very chilling
new details
about the suspect in the Boulder,
Colorado attack on a group
marching for the release
of Israeli hostages.
Authorities say he planned
the attack for a year.
He's now
charged with a hate crime
and attempted murder.
The Anti-Defamation League
the ADL says anti-Semitic
incidents are on the rise
here in the United States.
They're up more than 300%
over the last five years.
Joining us now is Democratic Congressman
Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey.
Congressman, thanks so much
for joining us.
Why do you think
we're seeing such a dramatic rise
in these anti-Semitic,
anti-Jewish incidents?
Well, well, thanks for having me.
As you pointed out.
2024 was actually the worst year
of other Semitic incidents
since the ADL began collecting that data.
And whether it's a combination
of factors, Wolf. Right.
We between social media
and extremist groups, we've seen more,
not just anti-Semitic attacks,
but more hate in general
against communities.
And and, Wolf,
it's unacceptable to target any one,
target any religion.
and anyone of any background.
But the reality is, what we saw this week
in Colorado was just
one incident of many,
especially anti-Semitic attacks
in the last weeks, right.
In Washington, DC, two were killed.
We saw an attack on the governor's
mansion in Pennsylvania.
So these are unfortunately
all too common.
How do we reverse this trend?
What do you think?
Well, you know, I
believe deeply,
in education
and especially with
with young people, right?
I mean, I think it's very,
very important
that we teach our kids
at an early age
about, you know, in terms of
in the Jewish faith, about the Holocaust,
about what happened on October 7th,
that we understand
the facts and history,
but also the fact that every community
should about their history
and their background,
because that's
what makes our country so great
that we're from all over the world
and from so many different backgrounds.
And we should celebrate those differences
and make sure that we appreciate them.
And too often now,
because of social media and
and cable news,
a lot of things
we're seeing actually more people,
attacking others
that are attacking those differences
instead of celebrating them.
And I we've got a lot of work to do also.
Obviously,
not just because of
what happened this week,
but because of what happens,
unfortunately, every day
in communities across our country
and here in new Jersey,
there were, protests
when you visited Rutgers
University in New Jersey last month,
leading to several arrests.
As a high profile Jewish politician,
are you concerned for your own safety?
Well, I
definitely think that
every elected official has to be careful.
I think that's critically important.
But, you know, what
I'm more concerned about,
Wolf, is the safety of the community.
And, you know, I was at,
temple this morning, and.
And what's,
so unfortunate
is that just to go pray now,
you need to have a lot of police
outside a temple, right?
Or for kids to go to a religious school,
you need a lot of law enforcement,
because, course, people don't feel safe.
And and that's unacceptable
in our great country for people
to not be able to go to, to go to just,
you know, have religious freedom
and feel safe about that.
And what we saw at Rutgers
and a lot of our colleges is a lot
was in a huge surge of these incidents,
especially anti-Semitic incidents
when I was at Rutgers, as you mentioned,
a couple weeks ago,
four people were arrested outside
where I was speaking.
one person
assaulted a law enforcement officer
with a flagpole
with a Palestinian flag on it.
You know,
that's not who we are as a country.
And and we obviously should stand up
very clearly and make and make it the
make it very clear to everyone.
There's no place for hate in new
Jersey or around our country."
OOMIiINxY_Q,FBI investigating Los Angeles protests over ICE raids,20250607,CNN,775989,"For a second consecutive day, tear gas and flash bangs have been used to disperse protests over immigration activity in the Los Angeles area.

On Saturday, protesters gathered in Paramount, California. Assemblymember José Luis Solache spoke with CNN's Jessica Dean, and CNN correspondent Julia Vargas Jones reports. #CNN #News","Breaking news out
of Los Angeles,
where the FBI says
it is investigating clashes
between law enforcement
and demonstrators.
These clashes began Friday
when crowds gathered around
federal law
enforcement officers
carrying out immigration raids
in that area.
And today,
right now, we're seeing police
using tear
gas and flashbangs
to clear the crowds.
California Assemblymember
Jose Luis Solache, who witnessed
what was unfolding
there, is joining us
now on the phone.
Assemblyman,
thank you so much
for being here with us.
I know you represent
the area, Paramount,
where we've been seeing
some of this happen.
Explain to us.
Describe to us
what you saw today.
Correct.
I've been here since 9 a.m..
When we first saw
the agents
drive up to my community,
I was actually on the freeway
with one of the vans
from Border Patrol.
And then I
did a U-turn type of situation.
I follow them,
and they were here
in my community.
There were seven agents
waiting to open a fence
throughout the morning
at about 60 different vehicles
have driven in there,
20, 25 of them
to us, our Border patrol,
logo vehicles and then about 30
plus vehicles were,
unmarked vehicles, SUVs.
and right now
I'm here in the city
and with my community,
there's about 65,
Border patrol agents.
They're there with, guns.
They're they're,
you know,
they're having
a staging process.
Of course,
communities out here
strong opposing these, raids
in our community
in Los Angeles.
I represent this district
in our community
is strongly here opposing this.
And we're looking at live video
while you're talking.
I see a lot of smoke.
There were some, like,
small fly, fires.
It looked like, in the distance
from where
we're looking at on this video.
We can see, people
who appear
to be gathered together,
and we're seeing some sort of,
agents as well.
we had a spokesperson
from DHS saying that,
that these protesters
were in a,
in a sense, violent,
that that's what
they're trying
to push back against.
Is that been your experience?
There's definitely
a variety of, demonstrators.
I, I have to be objective here.
And there's
some people that are,
of course, are angry.
They're passionate
about why they're why they,
you know, agents are here.
you have a variety of folks
that obviously are
here peacefully,
and there are
people
are a little more aggressive.
And that's just being
objective by,
of course, community's upset
and why they're even here
in our community.
Right. And, and.
And I represent
a very high immigrant, high
undocumented community
in my district,
which we're proud of, the
the work that we all contribute
to this country.
these are not criminals.
These are people
are hardworking,
people that are contributing.
And, of course,
that's what
people are angry about.
You're going to come and take,
you're doing raids
We're looking for people
that are at their workplace
after that,
since you're into
this country and
and they're not criminals.
So that's what people
are upset about,
including myself.
And it's roughly
it's 202 there.
Los Angeles time in your
where you are.
How long do you expect this
to go on?
Does it appear that it's
this is going to continue?
I've made my own
calls to, of course,
the governor's office
to, us
that we need to,
de-escalate this.
They just
send these people home
so that our community
go home and stop.
Stop this.
And we need to
de-escalate the situation
because people are upset.
I don't know
how long it's going to be here.
I came here
and signing in myself
with community,
and they've been standing
there, stage there,
and we've seen throughout
the morning
different vehicles,
leaving the facility.
And so we have,
a feeling that they're doing
great throughout
the LA, Los Angeles area.
And we have word
now that the FBI
is investigating
what's going on.
Have you seen any
FBI agents
or anyone like that
where you are?
Not as of now.
again, the
I've seen,
border patrol vests
and uniforms
that they are wearing.
The agents
we've got on the place,
they've been gassing people
as we get close to them,
anytime that we're vehicle
to leave the facility
at the parking lot,
they throw these staff.
They've been asking people
to move away from the area.
And so these vehicles
leave the premises.
And I have.
Not seen anyone from the FBI
here yet.
Yeah.
How often
would you say
you're hearing
these flash bangs or seeing,
this this tear gas deployed?
throughout the morning?
To be honest,
do you actually live closer
than just
just monitoring station?
I was affected myself
earlier because,
some there was shooting into
the artery of the area
where I was standing.
of course, I ran through that.
And it was
the first time I ever got gas,
in my eyes.
And of course, the coughing.
so it's my first time
experiencing.
And it's not a good feeling.
And have you seen
anyone be detained or arrested?
we did see about four people
that were arrested
that were, demonstrators.
they were on this side
of the fence demonstrating,
again, I can't,
justify why they were,
why they were being detained,
but obviously they
they were demonstrating
against,
being against the agents
being here physically,
not community.
Yeah.
And and again,
just to underscore
what you were saying,
it sounds like,
based on your description
that, the demonstrators
that are gathering range
in peaceful,
peaceful demonstrators,
to some
who are being more aggressive,
who are,
physically, pushing back.
They've, they've they've
been upset.
I've seen their to get closer
to the agents.
Of course. Right.
So of course
the agents are doing
their part to,
to show that they're part.
Right.
But people are, demonstrating
and there's
a lot of
peaceful demonstration,
but there are people
that obviously are just upset
and they're showing their anger
through that.
I have encouraged people
through my social media
to please be, peaceful.
That's what
demonstrating do not
use violence.
That's not what we want to do.
We don't want to add
to the narrative.
We want to make sure
that people are demonstrating.
We live in a democratic process
where people can express their
their feelings
and how they're feeling.
But of course,
do it in a peaceful manner.
Yeah.
And just again,
I just underscore
as we're talking to you,
we're looking at live
video and look,
there's a lot of
law enforcement there.
just the posture
that we're seeing
from law enforcement
in, in your neighborhood.
this is a big response.
It seems.
Yes.
We definitely don't have
any local authorities
because we don't
we don't engage
with a supporting
entity of ISIS,
you know,
strategies that they do.
So we don't have any local,
or state, agencies
collaborating with them.
They are working on their own.
I bet on that right
at this point.
All right.
If federal agents.
Yeah.
Assemblyman Solache,
thank you so much
for for your time.
We really appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
And thank you
for reporting this.
And we have to make sure we,
you know, keep community space.
Protests boiling over
for a second day
in the streets
of Los Angeles amid the Trump
administration's
immigration crackdown.
CNN correspondent
Julia Vargas Jones,
joining us now from Los Angeles
with the very latest,
Julia, what's
unfolding right now?
Well, these
operations are still ongoing
in Paramount, California.
That's just south
of Los Angeles.
Jessica, take a listen to
what is going on just now.
Now, a woman
who took another video of this
same scene
near that Home Depot there.
She said that she could smell
the tear gas in the air.
That,
officers, federal officers
had come to this Home
Depot where
generally people
gather to offer services
and that it was unclear
if anyone was arrested.
But we did see a response there
from the community
trying to impede those officers
from carrying out the spread.
We did hear
from the Department
of Homeland Security
just moments ago.
a statement from them saying
that, quote,
the violent
targeting of law enforcement
in Los Angeles
by lawless
rioters is despicable.
And Mayor
Bashs and Governor Newsom
must call for it to end.
The men and women of Ice
put their lives on the line
to protect
and defend the lives
of American citizens.
that again just now.
We're receiving this, Jessica.
This is as we're going into day
two of these kinds of clashes
yesterday.
Raids took place
in downtown Los Angeles,
at least three
different locations.
One of them,
another at Home Depot,
and the other one
was, in the fashion district
at a business
that was allegedly
using fictitious documents
for some of their workers,
according to the U.S.
Attorney's office. that again.
So we have that going on
yesterday, today,
and then as the news
continue to spread
yesterday of these raids,
that's when we see
protests swelling in downtown
Los Angeles, part of the city
being paralyzed
by these protests
as the community
was coming together to say
that they oppose
these kinds of targeted raids.
and that they were,
indiscriminate.
they were angered by this,
frankly, Los Angeles,
a city
that has so many immigrants,
about 10 million undocumented
immigrants in Southern
Cal in California.
A third of them are
here in Los Angeles County.
So this kind of reaction
is to be expected.
Yeah.
this is a developing story.
Julia will continue
to keep an eye on it
as things continue to escalate
there in Los Angeles.
we will certainly,
keep an eye out
for any more developments.
Julia Vargas Jones,
thanks so much."
kUwvieP8Jx4,He called for protests over ICE raid. Hear his reaction to violent escalation,20250609,CNN,47842,"CNN's Rosemary Church asks Pablo Alvarado, the co-executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network who called for peaceful protests to protect vulnerable immigrant communities, what he thinks about the violent protests in Los Angeles.  #CNN #News","I'm joined now by Pablo Alvarado.
He is co-executive director
of the National Day
Laborer Organizing Network
and joins us from Pasadena.
Thank you, Pablo, for talking with us.
Now, earlier in the day,
you made a nonviolent call
to action to all concerned citizens
to stand by those
under threat of deportation.
What response
did you get from those citizens?
I happen to live in Pasadena,
nearby the areas that were impacted by,
Ethan, fires.
And this morning,
we were notified that
there were Ice agents lodging at a hotel,
a local hotel, and the community,
began coming
to protest the presence
of those Ice agents who,
had already questioned the workers
who clean the rooms at the hotel.
And people
from all walks of life came to stand,
with those workers and to,
demand that they leave our city
because, our communities in this the,
Families being torn apart,
mother, sons, daughters,
grandfathers, children,
are being detained.
we've seen Ice agents going to Home Depot
to pick people up.
So we're asking people
who have the privilege to come out
and protest
and exercise their free speech rights,
to come and practice for those vulnerable
communities, peacefully.
And today,
in that community
showed up in large numbers.
and the message was loud and clear.
We don't want to see
your armored vehicles.
Men in masks
come into our communities
to pick people up with families apart.
The message was loud and clear,
and it was peaceful.
And this is what we want.
This is the moment
where we need to protest peacefully.
Yeah, that is the big message
here, isn't it?
Because I did want to ask you
how concerned you are
when you look
at the images that we're seeing there
from downtown L.A.,
when you see that violent protesters
and this is a completely different
group, violent protesters hijacking
your nonviolent cause, how does that
make you feel?
Well, the
anger is understandable
because you've seen armored vehicles
and I say guns armed to the teeth
coming into the neighborhood.
So I don't know who the
violent protesters are, but
the anger is justifiable.
Now, the violence, in my view, is
not because we can,
send the message that we want to send
without attacking anybody.
So and every time that there are
that there's violence,
that the most vulnerable communities
pay the price,
every time that there are riots,
we see the business of,
in our low income communities
that get burned down.
We see the violence that impacts people.
So obviously
we don't want that kind of violence,
but we don't
want the violence that the Ice agents
are actually engaging in as well,
because is it's,
in my view,
in so many senses,
the more violent to rape
a child from a family, from a mom
is more violent than what's happening in
in downtown L.A.
obviously,
any violence is condemned here,
and we don't want that in our community.
And
then, Pablo, where do
you take your fight from here,
your nonviolent fight?
What will happen
in the morning in the hours ahead?
What is your next step here?
Well, we're talking through
the authorities.
Were talking to them about,
keeping peace, you know, because,
when you have a situation
of violence,
de-escalation is very important.
And I believe that,
the authorities would actually,
hopefully they take the right measures
to de-escalate and allow,
peaceful protests to take place.
This is the moment when,
we really have to be careful about what
the next actions are.
We are asking people of good, conscious
people who believe that immigrants
are part of the social fabric.
economic and social economic fabric
of our communities
to come out,
people who give the keys
to their nannies, to a housekeeper
to come and clean their homes.
We're asking them to come Home Depot
and protect those who are
in vulnerable circumstances peacefully.
That's what we expect.
And that's where we want to see.
And I am sure
that's what we
what we were going
to see in the next days.
But it doesn't mean that,
things are not going
to get out of control.
And they are that
there are individuals
that might want to engage
in acts of violence.
There are also provocateurs
that we don't know who they are.
They might not even be protesters.
so this is all happening
when there's cars and the cars.
It's not the community
that it's that it's,
initiate
and it's the Ice agents
that have come in to communities
that have
engaged in that kind of violence
and the community response.
And it's unfortunate,
that we're going through this
in this moment.
Pablo Alvarado,
thank you so much for talking with us.
We appreciate it.
Thank you for inviting me.
Joining me now from Los
Angeles is Steve Moore,
a CNN law enforcement contributor
and a retired supervisory
special agent with the FBI.
Thank you, Steve, for talking with us.
Thank you.
So after three days of protests in LA,
we are now
moving into the overnight hours
with warnings
from law enforcement
that this could be a pretty rough night.
And we are already seeing that.
What are your greatest concerns right
now, given vehicles have been set ablaze
by protesters
and law enforcement
is responding with flashbangs, tear
gas, rubber bullets and in other ways?
Well, my my biggest concern
is the safety of the officers
as opposed to the people who are
who are remaining there,
who are really professional,
protesters, anarchists, things like this.
The people who were in the city,
protesting and utilizing
their First Amendment rights to speak.
Those people are long gone
because they're smart enough
not to be out when the anarchist takes
take over the, the protest.
And so I think
what you're going to find right
now is a different crowd out there
taking advantage of a situation
and my concern is that,
the police are and the,
federal agents are safe.
especially when chief McDonald says
the LAPD at this point is overwhelmed.
And, Steve, President Trump
went ahead
Sunday and federalized
California's National Guard
without the go ahead from the governor.
What's your reaction to that
very rare move
to deploy the National Guard
without Governor Newsom requesting it?
The governor
saying the move was, quote,
purposefully inflammatory
and will only escalate the tensions.
Well, as somebody
who worked the 92 riots, for the FBI,
I can tell you that
you want every bit of help you can get.
I do understand
that there are concerns about,
their deadly force policy versus
our deadly force policy.
That's
that's very logical and very important.
But at the same time,
you have to have enough people out there.
And yes, it is absolutely unimpressive
that a governor didn't first request
the National Guard
before a president sent it.
the, administrate
is a presidential
administration will say,
well, it's
because,
we had to protect federal buildings, the,
and the
and the Democratic governor,
for political reasons,
wouldn't ask for the, for the,
National Guard.
The governor will say, well,
it wasn't bad enough.
And so you've got a political situation
while the officers on the street,
they just want to get
a home safe at night.
And I suspect that they're grateful
for any help they can get run. Of course.
Sunday afternoon it was around 3 p.m.
la time, 6 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time.
The LAPD entered the area
trying to move the crowds back
and declaring the gathering
an unlawful assembly,
warning protesters
to clear the area
or face arrest and the risk of injury.
What will likely happen from here
in terms of law enforcement
as we're watching
through the night hours,
what's there likely next move here?
I think happily, from what I,
heard from chief McDonnell,
there's going to be
some cooperation
between the federal agents,
who are protecting federal properties
and the police.
I believe that they're probably going to,
if they haven't already declared
the entire city
a, an unlawful demonstration
and therefore cleared the streets,
kind of the same thing as a curfew.
And that way,
anybody who's on the streets,
you can only assume that they're there
for nefarious purposes.
And I think they'll work together
to try and clear the streets.
if they do that, expeditiously,
I think we could have
some sort of a quiet night,
but I don't think this is over.
Thank you for that.
Steve Moore
coming to us live there from LA.
Preciate it."
LTuSUcTSG9c,Dr. Phil was embedded with ICE during controversial Los Angeles immigration raids,20250609,CNN,159915,"As federal agents prepared to fan out in Los Angeles for a controversial immigration crackdown, the officers were greeted by a familiar face: Dr. Phil McGraw. The television personality and his camera crew were on hand before and after the raids that took place on Friday and triggered several days of street protests. CNN’s Brian Stelter reports.  #CNN #News","Let's shift back now to
Trump's immigration crackdown.
A new CBS poll showing that
showing that
while a majority of Americans
support the president's goal,
they are against his approach.
And as Friday's clashes
unfolded across L.A..
There was a familiar face,
maybe one that you wouldn't expect,
who was embedded with Ice agents
during Friday's raids.
It was Doctor Phil and his camera crew
who say that they got a firsthand
look at the targeted operations,
which ended with dozens of people
being detained.
He's expected to use that footage
in an upcoming report, reinforcing a made
for TV spectacle
that is Trump's controversial crackdown.
We have CNN chief media analyst
Brian Stelter with us now.
Brian, why was he there?
And it's something that's highly unusual.
I think it
really speaks
volumes about the administration's
made for TV strategy here.
They are focused on the visual spectacle,
and not just this week.
We could actually see it
back in the first week Trump
returned to office.
Doctor Phil was out in Chicago.
He was embedded back then on Ice raids.
This time
he was embedded
at the ice field office
in L.A.,
hanging out with Trump's border
czar, Tom Homan.
getting what Doctor Phil's
network calls
exclusive access to home in the day
before the operation.
Then on Friday morning,
he was there, I was told,
maybe even helping rally the,
the rally, the,
federal officials
before they headed out for the operation.
And then he was with Homan again
on Saturday.
So as I wrote on cnn.com,
Doctor Phil was out there
producing a show
that's going to air on
his relatively small cable channel today
and tomorrow is not the author ratings.
Ultimately, it's
about what this represents,
and it represents a desire
to put on a show,
especially for Trump
aligned media outlets,
that a desire to show
this immigration enforcement
is happening.
It's happening every day,
and Doctor Phil is a part of that effort
to televise it for the country.
What are Trump
aligned media outlets saying about this?
Well, number one,
that this is going to resolve
and we're down to Trump's benefit,
talking about, you know, polls that show
this is the top issue.
this is the area where Trump
has the most support among Americans.
You saw Stephen Chang, the Trump
adviser, over the weekend,
saying, look,
his approval
rating on immigration
is going to be even higher
after the National Guard
was sent to L.A..
So clearly, the white House believes
this is a winning issue.
We've heard Trump and his MAGA
media outlets refer to what
I call
the City in Ruins
storyline, referring to La as a place
that's in
it's in
ruins, basically,
and that Trump and his forces
are going to liberate it
and set it free again.
It sounds like something
out of an action movie, and even from the
the Defense Department earlier today,
you know,
the DoD's
rapid response account on ex
saying LA is burning.
And of course, Monday morning
there were no fires
burning this morning in LA.
So that kind of very hyped up,
very hyper charged rhetoric
coming from Trump,
coming from his agencies
and coming from his MAGA media outlets.
And I notice, Brianna,
we all live on our phones these days.
We're all scrolling through social media.
You got to be careful
at a delicate moment like this
to look at the time stamps,
look at the dates,
look at when things are actually posted
and if they're really from the situation
they're purporting to be.
A lot of these
algorithms are surfacing hours old
or even days old content.
So you might be looking
at a video of something
wondering what's happening in LA.
It's actually from two days ago.
And that's,
you know,
it only matters
because it can give people
a false impression
of what's actually happening
at a moment of unrest.
Yeah, and we've seen that before
in recent years of unrest.
Brian Stelter, thank you so much.
Really appreciate it, Boris.
As president Trump's
immigration crackdown
plays out, we're seeing more communities
expressing their support
for his controversial approach,
some of which we've reported on here
at CNN.
Georgia College student
was mistakenly pulled over
last month for a traffic violation
and kept on an immigration hold,
even after the charges were dropped.
Him in a
while was eventually released
after spending weeks in detention
in Massachusetts,
a high school student was arrested
on his way to volleyball practice.
Authorities said they were looking
for Marcelo Gomes,
the Silva's father,
and released him
after six days in custody.
Both of these cases
outraged their communities,
who then rallied around the teen's.
Let's get some perspective
from Victor Martinez.
He's the radio host
for Politics in Espanol.
Victor, thank you so much for joining us.
I understand that many of your listeners,
including Trump supporters,
are in favor of immigration enforcement,
but they're troubled
with how it's being carried out.
And I wonder,
where exactly do they believe
the line is crossed?
Well, first of
all, thank you for having me.
And yes,
especially Trump supporters,
Latino Trump
supporters
here in the state of Pennsylvania
where I'm in,
you can hear these Trump supporters
telling us,
wait a minute,
this is not what I voted for.
I thought he was going
to get the criminals,
the rapists and the murderers.
They trumped the drug traffickers,
not the people who are going to court
on their appointment.
And now they're being picked up in court.
And that is a big frustration.
That is
a big part of
why so many people are upset.
So on what's happening in Los Angeles,
there were more than two dozen
people arrested
for taking over the one on one highway,
for throwing Molotov cocktails,
for ramming police lines.
I wonder if you think the president
was justified
in sending in the National Guard,
or if you see this the way
that Governor Gavin
Newsom does, that this is
a manufactured crisis?
Absolutely.
I mean, there was no need to
for the president
to send a National Guard.
We see protests in this country,
in a weekly and a monthly basis.
is happening major scales.
And yet the National Guard is never used.
The governor has the state police.
Local authorities will handle it.
And if they do need
the National Guard, well,
that's always an option.
But when was the last time
that the president of the United States
called a National Guard
to handle something locally?
Protests? I'm in Pennsylvania.
In Philadelphia,
we had similar protests last year
where people took over the highways
and took over the streets.
And at no moment moments
the governor call for the National Guard,
nor the president
called the National Guard.
So, absolutely,
it was completely unnecessary.
And I think that just throw more wood
to the fire.
And as,
you were mentioning
in your previous segment,
it just makes it more of a show,
more of an opportunity
for the president to just,
make it look bigger
than what it is or worse than what it is
for his own benefit.
Victoria,
if you could stand by for a moment,
I just want to let our viewers
know that
as of a moment ago,
the California
attorney general has announced
that lawsuit against Trump's
federalization of the National Guard,
saying that Trump violated
the 10th Amendment and federal law,
saying that this was an unlawful action.
this is obviously something that was,
announced would be coming
by the governor of California,
and now it is officially filed.
I do want to ask you something, Victor.
about one aspect of the protests
that caught my eye
and received attention
from the administration,
and that's protesters who were waving
not only Mexican, but,
Guatemalan and Honduran flags,
among others.
The administration suggested
that they are insurrectionist invaders.
I wonder how you respond to that.
If you see that as un-American
or as a statement about cultural pride.
Absolutely.
So cultural of of pride,
a statement of pride.
I mean, we just had
the Puerto Rican parade in New York
yesterday, right?
And all
you saw along
Fifth Avenue in New York
were Puerto Rican flags.
It's our way to show support.
It's our way
to be proud of where we are from.
Yet we are here
and we are proud to be part
of this community as well.
and I don't doubt that
it was also an opportunity
for people from inside
about the world, or from Mexico
or from Guatemala
to let their fellow immigrants know, hey,
we are here with you.
I am from Mexico like you.
I'm from Guatemala
like you, and I'm here supporting you.
So when you see those images
that I'm
sure you've
you've noticed
because of these folks,
some of them assaulting
police, throwing things at police,
setting fires to vehicles,
throwing Molotov cocktails.
What's your message to those protesters?
Stop.
Don't do it.
You're making the situation worse.
You're not helping the cause.
You are giving the opportunity
for the president and others
to say, hey, you see?
Look at that.
It's it's necessary.
Look, we have to call the National Guard.
So if anybody's out there is listening
and for whatever
my message is worth, stop.
It hurts the cause.
we know that you're hurting.
We know that you're upset.
We understand we're with you.
But those type of behaviors,
what they do is hurt our community
because then
they get transmitted through CNN.
And unfortunate,
it doesn't help our community.
And the point of us protesting,
the point of us
arguing that we are being mistreated,
that we're being abused
and I just want to make it clear
our communities care.
And some people in our
community have had enough.
You know,
we've been told that
these are criminals,
rapists, drug dealers
who are being deported or arrested.
But we can see the videos every day
on social media of people going to court,
doing the right thing, following the law,
and they're getting picked up in court,
not in some backdoor or,
alleyway.
Now they're being picked up in court
with their lawyers.
I've seen video on social media
in New York,
in Manhattan, people
who are in court with their lawyers,
doing the right thing, doing,
following the process
the way they're supposed to.
And yet there is an immigration officer,
an Ice officer,
picking him up and taking them to jail."

They are one of the best police

We've
had very peaceful protests yeste

1jZ7QOciE6M,75-year-old Cuban immigrant dies in ICE custody,20250701,CNN,646495,"Isidro Pérez, a 75-year-old Cuban man who was paroled into the United States in 1966, died on June 26 after having been in ICE detention for three weeks. CNN's Boris Sanchez speaks with Claire Healy of the Miami Herald and ex-ICE acting director John Sandweg. #CNN #News","As President Trump
tours the
new detainment center
that he's calling
Alligator Alcatraz.
We're learning more
about one migrant
recently held at a nearby
South Florida facility.
This is 75 year old
Isidro Perez.
He's pictured here
with his family,
the guy with the beard
in the background.
He's a Cuban immigrant
who came to the United States
nearly six decades ago.
Likely allowed entry
under parole programs
for Cubans fleeing Fidel
Castro's communist regime.
He came to the
United States back
when he was 16 years old,
reportedly working
as a mechanic and fisherman.
But in
June, Perez was arrested by ICE
when his family says
that he was sitting
at a community center.
You can see him here
in this photo
provided by a family friend.
The white
beard, his hands
behind his back.
I says that he was charged
with inadmissibility
pursuant to the Immigration
and Nationality Act.
He was sent about an hour
east of the facility
where President
Trump toured today
to Krome Detention Center,
which in recent weeks
has been in the spotlight
for moments like this one
around the time of Perez's
arrest.
Local media captured
this demonstration.
It's a group of detainees
at Krome Standing,
and what you can see
is an S.O.S.
formation
essentially asking for help.
According
to a medical intake completed
the day after Perez's arrest.
He had been diagnosed
with multiple health problems.
His former partner, Maria
Alaniz, told the Miami
Herald that the 75 year old
complained of severe
overcrowding at Krome
and of there not
being enough beds
and him
having to sleep on the floor.
About two weeks
after entering Krome,
Perez had to be taken
to a local hospital,
where ICE says
that he was admitted
with unstable
angina cardiac issues
that could lead
to a heart attack.
ICE says that he was discharged
last Wednesday,
but then the next day
he reported chest pains
and suffered
a medical emergency.
Rescue crews
were able to revive him
and then transfer him
to a local hospital
for treatment.
But a short time later
he was pronounced dead.
So why was this 75 year
old man found it admissible
into the United States?
After being here
for almost 60 years?
It may be because
some 40 years ago,
in the early 1980s,
Perez was convicted twice
for possession
of a controlled substance.
Court records
uncovered by the Miami Herald
show that
in one of those cases,
he and another person
were stopped on a boat
and charged with possession
and intent to distribute
some 1,500 pounds of marijuana.
At the same time,
a judge sentenced him
to 18 months in prison
with two years probation.
A family
member told the Herald that
the stint in prison
actually gave Perez
the opportunity
to turn his life around,
and he became an
excellent person
who helped his loved ones,
especially the young ones,
learn to swim and fish.
In a letter
notifying Congress
that he'd passed,
ICE says that, quote,
it remains
committed to ensuring that
all those in its custody
reside in safe, secure
and humane environments.
Comprehensive medical care
is provided from the moment
individuals arrive
throughout the entirety
of their stay.
Here's the president's border
czar Tom Homan
at the White House.
When he was asked
about Perez's case.
I'm unaware of that.
I'm not aware of that.
Many people
that die in ICE custody,
people die in county jail,
people die in state prisons.
I mean,
if you look at you know,
when I was ICE director
and we drill down that
the question should be
how many lives, as I say,
because when they go
in detention,
we find many diseases
and stuff that we deal with
right away to prevent death.
So I'm not aware
that specific case,
but I'll say this.
People, people
can argue with me
all they want,
but the facts are the facts.
I think that politicians
and New Jersey found this out,
that we have
the highest detention
standards in the industry.
The official cause of death
for Isidro
Perez is still
being investigated.
His family,
though, has questions,
including his stepdaughter,
who told the Miami
Herald, quote,
Joining me now to discuss
is Claire Healy.
She's an investigative
fellow at the Miami Herald.
And also John Sandweg
a former acting ICE
director under President Obama.
Thank you both
for being with us, John,
with the information
that we've gathered on Isidro
Perez,
do you believe that
he was a public safety threat
or a national security threat,
someone who needed
to be removed
from the United States?
Boris.
No, I certainly don't
think he's a public
safety threat.
I think one of the realities
that people don't understand
about immigration
detention is often two things.
One is one
is obviously
this administration has taken
an approach
of detaining everybody.
However,
even after you're detained by
certain individuals,
are eligible for bond hearings
before immigration judges.
But oftentimes, those
that eligibility hinges on
how you enter
the United States.
In this case,
he was paroled
into the United States,
and most likely he was deemed
not bond eligible.
I think this is a larger issue
that we need
to look at writ large.
And whether you're
for immigration detention
or inside
for those mass deportation plan
or against a Republican
or Democrat,
we all should question
why are we relying
so heavily on detention,
especially when, you know, it's
so much more expensive?
It's not necessary.
And ankle bracelets have proven
to be
a very effective deterrent.
And the final thing
is, it's very hard
to operate a detention system
that is entirely safe.
You're just congregating
lots of people in an area
where it's difficult
to provide medical treatment.
And of course,
those issues are exacerbated
right now
by the overcrowding
that we're seeing
in the ICE facilities.
Claire,
I should tell you that
I grew up in Miami,
and as a kid growing up,
you would hear horror stories
about what happened at Krome.
It was almost like
a haunted house.
The folklore
that would come out of there.
Talk to us about that facility.
What do we know about it?
Yeah.
So Krome is located in
the Everglades
outside of Miami,
and around February,
we started hearing reports
from detainees
talking about severe
overcrowding,
people sleeping on the floor
and in overcrowded rooms.
My colleagues and I spoke with,
three former detainees
in March and lawyers
for three more.
And they said that,
the conditions
were extremely unsanitary.
You know, people were crowded
in these very, packed rooms.
And one woman
who was deported to Honduras
said that a group of women
were left overnight on a bus.
It was so crowded
and they were forced to urinate
in their seats, in shackles.
And so
we know from what
they were describing
that this is a facility
that was really
pushed to to its brink.
And then we've been hearing
similar reports
lately, actually,
Isidro Perez,
before he passed away,
he told his family
that he had been
sleeping on the floor
in a crowded room
when he first got to Krome.
So we're hearing
similar stories now.
And, when we talk about deaths
across the country,
there have been ten, in 2025
so far,
five have been in Florida,
and three of those five,
were detained at Krome
prior to their deaths.
I should let our viewers know
that we reached out to Isidro
Perez, his family.
they told us that they were,
too heartbroken
and despondent to, speak to us.
I wonder, Claire,
what you have heard from them
and how they're
doing right now.
Well, this is an
extremely difficult
time for the family.
You know, they are grieving.
This this news is very new.
They just found out on Friday.
from officials and they.
Yeah, they are really mourning,
you know. Yeah.
Isidro
Perez raised a daughter
and six stepchildren
in Key Largo.
He was very close
with his ex-spouse.
she described him
as a beautiful friend
who, she spoke
to nearly every day.
prior to he.
When he was detained,
she would bring him meals.
They supported each other,
over the last four decades.
Really?
And they raised these
children together,
you know, in Key Largo.
He taught them how to fish.
He taught them how to swim.
he, as one of his stepchildren
said, really
taught them, survival skills.
And they,
you know, as a family,
cared deeply about him.
And this is a really
difficult time.
And as you mentioned
at the beginning
of this conversation,
they have some questions,
you know,
mainly they
they were, questions
about why he was detained.
he had a long medical history,
and his ex-wife said that he,
he was,
raising concerns to her
about not receiving
his medication
before he passed away.
So they want to know
about that.
And, the treatment
before he died.
so they do have those questions
about what led to his death.
They said they were
not informed
he was in the hospital,
immediately.
And so
they have questions about that.
I think it's a lot to process.
one thing we've been hearing
repeatedly from,
from different family members,
not the Perez,
relatives,
but other family members,
and sometimes they hadn't heard
from their relative in weeks.
Canadian man died here
at a federal detention center
last week.
And, and his
family told us they
they have been
trying to contact him
and haven't been able to.
And so
for these family members
grieving across the country,
they have questions
and really just
a lot of mourning.
And added on to that
sometimes is the fact
that they haven't seen
their family members
spoken to them, in some time.
please do
let us know
if they hear from him.
Claire Healy, John Sandweg, rath
If they hear from
administration officials,
I should say my mistake.
Claire Healy, John
Sandweg, thank you both.
Thank you so much."
mnUufu8e6OM,Woman released from ICE custody after nearly five months,20250705,CNN,715271,"Ward Sakeik, who was detained by ICE officials as she returned from her honeymoon in the US Virgin Islands, has been released after nearly five months in detention, an attorney representing her confirmed to CNN affiliate WFAA. Despite being “stateless” and living in the US since she was eight years old, ICE detained her and attempted to deport her twice - according to attorneys – even after telling ICE she was allowed to be in the country legally. CNN's Danny Freeman speaks with Sakeik and her lawyer Eric Lee. #CNN #News","This morning, a woman is
finally home in Dallas
after spending 140 days
in ICE custody.
Ward Sakeik was born in Saudi
Arabia to Palestinian parents.
She's lived
in the United States
since she was eight years old.
She was arrested by immigration
officials back in February.
She was returning
from her honeymoon to the U.S.
Virgin Islands
with her new husband
when she was taken
into custody.
Now we reached out
to the Department
of Homeland Security,
who said
in a statement in part.
Well, joining
me now is Ward Sakeik
and her attorney, Eric Lee.
Thank you
both so much
for joining us
on this holiday weekend.
Ward, I want to start with you.
Can you please just tell me
about your experience
being detained
and how you're
feeling this morning?
Thank you.
first of all, I
feel good this morning.
I feel amazing being back home.
And I'm super grateful
to be here.
the entire detention
process was not great.
I wouldn't
wish this upon anybody.
it was very hard.
very traumatizing
and very, very difficult.
is what I would say to that.
Well, Ward,
can you describe
a little bit more?
I mean,
just what it was like inside
while you were
detained for so many,
so many weeks?
Yes, absolutely.
There was
not a lot of things
for us to do.
it was a very lazy,
it was lazier
than the next day.
you know, like,
run out of energy.
I didn't have much energy to do
pretty much anything.
All I had was
my husband sending me
books, and I would be reading
once these books were done.
Send them back, get more books.
we did have some Zumba
and some dancing classes
provided to us.
It wasn't a daily thing,
but it was.
It was pretty, pretty nice.
And the second facility
that I was in,
there wasn't a lot of people
that spoke English in there.
There was a lot of,
Latin women.
So it was very hard
for me
to make a lot of friends.
So often
I just felt like
I was a little isolated
because I didn't really
speak the language.
So again, I,
I was in an environment where
I wasn't fully comfortable.
And not only that,
I was also very scared
because
it was very different to me.
I didn't know why I was
there specifically,
even though I was asking,
and I really wanted to speak
to my deportation
officer and all that.
because I've been
abiding by everything,
and I was complying,
and I was very confused on
why I was there,
especially when
I report every year
and they congratulate me
on everything I've done
or any new updates in my life.
So this is very confusing
for me.
Eric,
I want to bring you
into the conversation,
your client's circumstance.
very unique.
I understand
that Ward
does not actually have
citizenship anywhere.
Is that correct?
And how does that make
this whole case
more challenging?
Right.
Ward is a Palestinian.
the United States government
does not recognize
Palestine as a country.
Her family,
like the families
of so many Palestinians, were,
were kicked off of their land
many decades ago
and forced essentially,
into international diaspora.
The government cannot deport
her to any country.
She has been,
as she just indicated,
complying with all of the,
supervisory demands
that ICE has placed on her
over the last years.
I just want to say,
since since you started
by reading the statement
by the Department
of Homeland Security,
they also issued a statement
yesterday to Newsweek
saying that what Ward said
about her
conditions of detention,
including regarding food,
including regarding water,
mistreatment by guards,
the violation of her
religious right, was false.
DHS said they called it
a sob story.
I guess what we would ask
the American people is,
who are they going to believe
their lying eyes,
or the statements of the people
who are responsible
for carrying out
what are really crimes
against humanity here
in the United States.
On Monday,
when Ward was brought
out of the
almost out of the facility
for her second
deportation attempt,
that was in violation
of a federal court order
saying that the ICE
was prohibited
from trying to remove her
from the United States.
This is a government
which is actively undermining
and violating
the American Constitution
and the Bill of Rights,
and the case that Ward--
Ward's case exemplifies
the basic question
that everybody
should be thinking
about on this 4th
of July weekend,
which is whether we
live in a democracy
or whether we live
in a dictatorship.
Well, to
your point,
Eric, I
mean, tell me what is next
in Ward's case,
is it pretty much over,
or is there more coming now?
Well,
there's going to
be more coming.
I mean, the what
what that
how that develops
not only for Ward,
but for the tens of thousands
of people
who every night
in this country,
go to sleep in the conditions
that Ward was forced to endure
for five years
simply for the crime,
in most cases
of having been born
in another country
and trying to come here
for a better life.
I mean, this is America.
There's a network of internment
camps
across the United States
set up by Democratic
and Republican administrations,
where families are detained,
where parents are taken
from their children.
They just built
something that they call
Alligator Alcatraz, which
which is as horrific
as it sounds.
There's Marines in Florida
helping ICE,
and, attack
the rights of immigrants
in that state.
And they've just passed
a bill in Congress
which isn't not beautiful,
which is,
going to
fund Ice to the tune
of having more resources
at its disposal
than many militaries
across the world.
This is an extraordinarily
dangerous situation.
We have to really make
the point
that the situation
Ward confronts
shows that nobody's safe.
They're talking about
denaturalizing American citizens
They're trying to,
enforce what types of speech
immigrants can engage in
and what types of speech
American citizens can listen
to immigrants engage in
that is totally outside
the American
democratic tradition
that was embodied
in the Declaration
of Independence that was signed
almost 250 years ago.
Well, Ward,
glad you're back home.
And, please stay in
touch with us
to keep us abreast of
just how you're progressing.
in the weeks
and months to come.
Thank you both. Ward.
second and,
Eric Lee,
for joining us this morning.
Appreciate your time.
Thank you.
A group of state
lawmakers in Florida
are now raising
humanitarian concerns
about the controversial
new migrant detention center
in the Everglades.
The five Democrats
say they were refused entry
and denied the opportunity
to inspect the facility,
nicknamed Alligator Alcatraz.
CNN's Rafael
Romo has the latest.
Danny. Good morning.
The lawmakers say
they were
worried about
humanitarian concerns
that the new detention
center in Florida,
and that's why
they wanted
to assess conditions
inside by personally
visiting the site.
But they didn't get too far.
The lawmakers say they weren't
even allowed to see
the outer perimeter
of the facility,
known as Alligator Alcatraz.
Only hours
after the arrival
of the first group
of detainees.
A lawyer
with the Florida Division
of Emergency Management,
which oversees
the detention center, later
cited a safety concern
for the denial without offering
specific details,
according to one
of the lawmakers.
CNN, of course, has reached
out to the office for comment.
President Donald Trump
toured the facility on Tuesday
along with this
Homeland Security Secretary
Kristi Noem and their host,
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Shortly after their visit.
Summer storms flooded
part of the facility.
Video from CNN affiliate
shows wires
submerged in pooling water
across the floor.
High winds made the floor
and walls
of the facility tremble.
Florida officials later said
that, quote,
vendors went back and tightened
any seams
at the base of the structures
that allowed water
intrusion
during the heavy storm,
calling it minimal.
Florida State Representative
Anna Eskamani,
one of the lawmakers
trying to visit
the facility,
referred to the detention
center as a political stunt.
Based on reports that
we've been able to glean.
The site is already
experiencing flooding.
the first,
individuals
who have been detained
with no due
process have arrived.
And it's so essential
when you have hundreds
of millions of public dollars
being spent
on a political stunt
that we have the ability
to see for our own eyes
what is happening
and to be the voices
of our constituents.
Publicly on Tuesday,
federal and state officials
said they were working
together on this.
But in a court filing
submitted the following day,
the Department
of Homeland Security
said it has not been
directly involved.
The court filing
says, in part,
that, quote,
An official with Immigration
and Customs Enforcement
also said
that the agency's role
has been limited
to touring the facility
to ensure compliance
with ICE detention standards.
Danny,
Rafael Romo, thank you
very much for that report."
NyHlHzyhPXg,Mahmoud Khalil describes conditions at ICE detention facility,20250711,CNN,74715,"Detained for more than 100 days without charge, and with the threat of deportation looming over him, Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil was convinced he would eventually prevail. In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Khalil, who is now back with his young family, describes the months languishing in a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, and the pain of being denied permission to be present at his son’s birth.  #CNN #News","The worst crimes
under international
law are being committed
all over the world.
Right now,
focus continues on the war in Gaza,
with the International Criminal Court
still seeking the arrest
of the Israeli prime minister
and his former defense minister.
The Hamas leaders,
who are indicted by the ICC
have now all been killed by Israel.
This war has divided
communities and raised fury
all over the world,
particularly fraught
in the United States,
where you can even end up behind bars
for your views.
One example
Palestinian activist and Columbia
graduate Mahmoud Kalil.
He played an integral role
in the antiwar campus protests last year,
and it made him a target in Trump's
battle with universities,
free speech, immigration,
all in the name
of combating anti-Semitism.
In March of this year, Ice officials
seized him from his apartment
and threatened to revoke his green card.
After three months in detention
without charge,
Halil was finally released on bail.
His story has outraged many
and I spoke to him
asking how it felt to be in the
middle of Trump's crackdown.
Mahmood, welcome to the program.
Thank you. Thank you for having me.
Take me back to that day,
which was awful for you and your family
and all your friends and relatives
and people watching
when they came to your house.
I think it was night time
and we have some video and seized.
You don't need to be doing that.
Yeah.
Christian, it felt like
kidnaping, having,
plainclothes agents follow me
into the lobby of my building.
a private space,
threatening my wife with, arrest
if she wouldn't separate from from me.
refusing to answer.
any any any questions
they have refusing to produce,
a warrant addressed,
and basically like saying
all the wrong things like that.
I have a student visa.
they did not believe that
I am a green card holder.
so it
literally felt like
kidnaping extra judicial.
targeting,
and for the next 24 or 30 hours,
I was literally moved from one place
to another, like an object.
So, they,
they took me to an office in New York,
then in new Jersey to Texas,
then to Louisiana,
which is literally 1400,
miles away from, from, New York.
So it was it would,
it would have been,
easier to fly from New York to London,
than actually take me to Louisiana
and probably more comfortable.
Let me just ask you. Absolutely.
Were you harmed at all at any time?
Were you beaten
where you rough handed were
were you harmed?
I was shackled all the time.
shackled like. Like this.
And my my, my ankles, ankles as well.
it felt like I was criminal.
I did not know what,
charges they have against me.
and, by the time I arrived in
Louisiana, my
my my leg was was fully swallowed.
I couldn't walk.
to to enter the the detention center.
so it was very,
very dehumanizing experience, for someone
who was not accused of any crime,
whatsoever.
you say that because there's no charges.
No formal charges against you,
and you mention
you're a green card holder,
and that is a lawful
permanent resident of the United States.
Have they
have you still got your green card?
Have they taking it away?
Revoked it.
they it's
it's they are in the process
of of revoking my green card.
I still have it as, as,
like a lawful, residency.
and as you said,
the charges against me
are immigration related.
they are not criminal.
or the I or civil actually
is just like that.
I am a foreign policy
threat to the United States.
the irony.
or they later, added,
retaliatory, charges that I
misrepresented my green card application.
given that I submitted my my,
my green card application
a year before my arrest,
and it was approved by the same,
Department of Homeland Security.
So let's talk about the accusations.
You say it was, you know,
foreign policy related.
Let's get it absolutely straight.
President Trump on Truth Social
called, you quote, a radical foreign
pro Hamas student.
His spokeswoman, Carolyn
Levitt, said that you were, quote,
siding with terrorists.
Why do you think they said that
about you?
And as we, you know, as
we described when we introduced you,
you were one of the student
protest leaders,
in this very fraud situation of the war
between Israel and Gaza
on Columbia University campus.
What did you think when they
when they said that about you?
It's absurd.
it's basically to, to intimidate me.
they want to conflate any speech
for the right of Palestinians, with,
a speech that's,
supporting terrorism,
which is totally wrong.
the protests where,
where peaceful where, asking a simple,
ask to a stop
a Columbia University
and the US complicity
and and
the genocide that's happening in Gaza.
and that's why I see
these accusations as intimidation.
the and that's why it did not,
they did not succeed in, in court.
I mean, as as as as of yet,
and it's just like, to distract
from what's really happening.
they want to distract us from the U.S.
support and conditional support
to Israel.
And its
and its genocidal war, and America's,
this is what what's happening,
what happened to me and to others.
And it's a message
that they want to make
an example out of me,
even if you are a legal resident.
even if you are a citizen, actually,
that we will find a way to,
come after you, to punish you,
if you speak, against what we want.
can I just ask you
because, you know, you're
right in the middle of it,
and you were a student leader,
and as you say, the the
the events
that you were involved in were peaceful.
You never masked yourself.
I don't think you never claimed to be,
you know, Hamas or pro Hamas.
But I want you just to
try to understand that
in some other universities
there were people in the immediate
aftermath pro Palestinians,
in the immediate
aftermath of October
7th, who essentially blamed Israel and,
you know, even exacerbated,
even support for Hamas.
And I wonder whether you think
in retrospect, these protests were
the early ones,
maybe even some Columbia campus
was self-defeating
and got you all in the kind of
trouble that you're in now.
what's what's self-defeating
and what's what's dangerous is actually,
continuing.
the killing in in Palestine,
this is what these students,
speak, or spoke out against,
and from from the moment
that these students
spoke out against Israel,
they were labeled anti-Semite.
that they are creating
a hostile environment to Jewish students.
again,
this is just like
deliberate distortion from reality.
these students did not actually like,
or the protests themselves.
did not create a hostile environment
for, for, for Jewish students.
The Jewish students
were an integral part of this,
of this movement because, their Jewish
values, and, and teachings,
told them that they should stand up,
against injustice,
especially when these injustices
are being committed by a state,
or by a state that claiming to represent,
to represent them.
so I, I refuse this, sort of,
connotation that these protests were
in any way
violent in any way and disinvite,
what's violent is, is universities
and governments,
penalizing
and criminalizing, freedom of speech.
this is what we really should
look at right now.
we should focus on
actually why
these students are protesting right now.
It is because their universities
and the U.S.
government
is fully invested
in the killing of the Palestinian people.
it's it's as plain as as as that.
And they take safety and, and,
antisemitism concerns
very, very, very seriously.
but we have to, to distinguish between,
between discomfort, effort,
and safety.
When you came out and I'm asking you this
because people will ask you,
you did actually,
you know, walk around
with a bunch of people, protesters
who were chanting from the river
to the sea,
that whole thing
that seems to just drive people
mad, even though the Israeli government
says it as well.
People just seem to think
that that is a connotation
for destroying a people
for, you know, for
for all the issues of anti-Semitism that,
that those concerned have raised.
Why do you keep using it?
What's the point
in the value of that slogan anymore,
since both sides use it?
Yeah, that's that's a fair question.
And
and protesters
keep using it because language matters.
history matters. And,
and from the river to the sea is a call
for justice, for freedom for all people.
Between,
the Jordan River
and the Mediterranean Sea.
Unfortunately, the, the pro-Israel camp
in this country
and around the world,
they would rather mis deliberately,
mis, represent, this this slogan,
because for them to cancel speech
is easier than actually engaging
and reflecting.
on on, on on this speech.
and I even would go like further
with the globalized intifada,
that now the whole
the whole country
is mad about globalized.
The intifada is
we have to take it within it
is, context
because, globalized
the intifada is a call
to globalized solidarity.
in in
the world,
the intifada
is simply a word for uprising.
And I don't want to give a history lesson
now about like
intifada, like First intifada
and Second Intifada, where
we're largely a mass civil,
resistance against Israel,
apartheid and Israeli occupation.
with it in the 90s, or
early, 2000.
so this is again goes
with, with the fact that,
what we should be worried
about is, is bomb
the bombs that are killing people
rather than
the chance
that are making
some people uncomfortable.
You know, there are people.
There are
people who are going to ask you,
do you condemn?
And I'm going to ask you
what Hamas did on October 7th.
Yeah.
I condemn targeting, and violence
against all civilians,
and international low.
is it clear about that?
I also condemn the selective,
outrage.
on on on on on on such,
circumstances, because they also condemn
the 75 year of dispossession of,
of ethnic cleansing,
of killing of Palestinians.
And, and this is not just justification.
It's it's really dealing
with the root causes, of of of, the,
the war against, Palestinians.
You have come out as determined as ever
to speak up for your cause
and for the justice of your people.
They didn't beat that out of you
in jail or or,
you know,
push you to take a different track.
Tell me again
what it was like in jail in terms of,
I don't know, the food,
the sleeping, the, the,
the people who you were in there with,
what was it like?
And did you ever risk
your spirit being broken?
from from the moment
that I was detained, I knew that,
I would eventually prevail,
that I what I simply did
is protesting a genocide.
in terms of conditions.
And this is what I keep saying.
The moment you enter such facilities,
such eyes. Facilities.
you would you rights
literally stay outside?
on the inside as
as you would expect,
the food was as close
as could be to inedible.
I had to switch to vegetarian
because the meat,
was.
I threw up, like, after
after I ate the meat there.
it was so cold.
We had to ask for more blankets.
but no one would answer.
our our, our requests.
a lot of people inside, like,
they they don't know,
their rights, they they they
are not allowed, to,
to to question like I is
about, like why you brought me here.
Because a lot of them were brought
from the court.
Literally, someone was in his court,
defending his case, asylum
case, and was taken into custody.
from, from a from court.
so it's there's a lot of dehumanization.
the Trump administration
is trying to paint all these, like,
undocumented people as criminals.
however, it's it's the opposite.
it's totally the opposite.
A lot of them
have been in the United States for,
long number
for, for a large number of years.
they have, U.S citizen
like, family, family members.
yet yet they feel that,
they are defeated.
You missed the birth of your first child,
a boy.
Everybody was very concerned
about your wife
who is an American citizen,
that without you.
Well, what was that like?
And then what was it
like when you were first able
to hold your child for the first time?
Missing
the birth of my child.
I think that was
the most difficult moment in my life.
especially because, like,
this could have been, avoided.
we we put so many requests to be able,
to attend that that moment.
and I will not.
I don't think I would be able
to forgive them, for,
taking that moment away from, from me.
the first time I saw
my child was literally,
through, thick glass.
he was literally in front of me, like,
five centimeters away from me, yet
I couldn't hold him.
and when the moment came to hold him,
it was by court to order,
to have one hour with with him.
so, to be honest, my.
It's I just
can't describe that that moment.
and, it's a combination of of anger
and happiness.
I was happy that I'm finally was finally,
holding him in my hands,
but at the same time
angry at the system
that deprive these people from,
from such, such important moments
in their lives.
Thank you so much for being with us."

exclusive interview
is Democratic Senator Alex
Padilla of California.
Thank you so much
for being here.
what he, Tom Homan did
was say that
the federal judge
was just plain wrong.
And what the judge ruled.
just so our viewers
know on Friday,
is that
the tactics that ISIS is using
are likely violation
of the Constitution, suggesting
that immigration agents
are detaining people, quote,
based on race alone.
Homan said
that's just not true.
What do you think?
Well,
wouldn't be the first time
the Trump administration tries
to just dismiss a court order.
and so it's our job to ensure
that we uphold the law,
uphold the Constitution.
I mean, Homan has said it,
very clearly
in other interviews.
They're not even asking for,
you know,
significant findings
to detain people.
They're going
based on appearance.
His words, not mine.
Based on occupation.
His words,
not mine based on accents
in a physical appearance.
Dana,
what if I was
outside of Home Depot?
Because I like to do
some work around the house,
not dressed in a suit.
Would I be a
target of ICE enforcement
under Tom Homan?
Probably.
and it's just wrong.
It's not just due
process rights
that have become the concern,
but racial profiling.
When federal agents
involved in
immigration enforcement
are using racial profiling,
they're not enforcing the law.
They are breaking.
I basically
asked him about that.
He said that he's being,
misunderstood,
that it's factors within us
and not a factor
like the way somebody looks
or the way they talk.
Yeah,
but he laid out the factors
that he's,
you know,
encouraging them to consider.
Again,
it is appearance,
it's accent, it's occupation.
Okay.
Construction workers,
farm workers, you name it,
the evidence is out there.
And here's
the other thing about evidence.
He claims to be prioritizing
those violent,
dangerous criminals.
We've been hearing this
ad nauseum
from the Trump administration
going back to the campaign
trail.
The numbers suggest otherwise.
The vast
majority of people
that have been detained
and even those deported
have no,
serious criminal conviction.
History.
If it was only going
after dangerous criminals,
there would be no debate,
no discussion.
that's I agree with that.
But the fact of the matter
is, the vast
majority of those
being detained
are the same people
who were deemed
essential workers
at the end of the first Trump
administration
at the outset of the Covid
19 pandemic.
That's a cruel, cruel irony.
We learned overnight
that a migrant farm
worker died after he fell
from a roof
during ICE raids in Ventura
County, in your state.
Have you been able
to talk to the family?
haven't, spoken
with the family directly,
but have been in touch with,
you know, president
of the United Farm
Workers union.
I've known her for a long time.
We've been in touch.
over the last several days.
She's been with the family
and other families of people,
that are literally terrorized
and traumatized
based on what Ice is doing.
again, if all they're doing
is going after serious,
violent criminals,
that'd be one thing.
But because of these
artificial quotas
established by
what Donald Trump
or Stephen Miller or somebody
in the administration,
it's causing Ice
to get more aggressive,
more cruel, more extreme.
And these are the result.
It's people dying.
because of fear and terror
caused by this administration.
It's not just,
undocumented immigrants or
lawful immigrants
that are being rounded up.
There's United States citizens
that are being detained.
There are military
veterans who.
Collateral arrests.
You know,
he called it
collateral arrests.
Yeah,
that's how dismissive
they are
about the people impact,
let alone the economic impact
that we're all
going to be paying.
Let me ask you about,
some of the the,
unrest that's happening in
and around the ICE agents
as well.
Officials are looking
for a suspect
who appeared to fire
a gun
at a federal agent
during a raid.
A few days
before that, ten
people were arrested
after opening fire
outside an immigration
detention facility
in Texas, injuring
a police officer.
Authorities say
it was a planned ambush.
Earlier this week,
a man with a rifle
and tactical gear
was shot dead
after firing at Texas
Border Patrol.
At least a facility.
Are you
worried that heated rhetoric
around this
and around
the policies
are actually putting
law enforcement agents at risk?
first, let me just denounce
any violence.
Any violence against
law enforcement
is unacceptable.
to me, I think heated
rhetoric is,
you know,
part of what's
causing this response.
Sadly, yes.
And we've seen
this administration
escalate and escalate
and escalate
in all ways and matters,
whether it's the tactics of
with which they're going
about immigration enforcement.
There's a smarter,
more effective
way to do this
than what they're doing.
They say that it's
the Democrats rhetoric,
some calling
Ice agents secret police,
comparing them to the Gestapo.
Well,
I wouldn't use those words,
but I do have concern
when there are no,
requirements for Ice agents
or other federal
agents involved
with the immigration
enforcement actions
to not even
identify themselves.
I mean, if you're
a member of a working class
immigrant community
and you see unmarked cars
rolling into your community,
people
getting out of those cars
with no identifiers,
that they are law enforcement
and not just detaining
in your mind, maybe kidnaping.
So that's why Senator Booker
and I have this bill
to require that identification
for ICE agents
or anybody involved
with immigration enforcement.
It's for the safety of officers
and agents
as well as safety
for the community
and to protect against people
exploiting the circumstances,
impersonating ICE agents
and getting involved
with burglary, theft,
kidnaping, sexual assault,
and worse.
The president, as you know,
says that they wear masks
to protect their own
identity from,
from people who want to go
after law enforcement.
I do want to change gears,
because we're
almost out of time
to the tariffs
that President Trump
announced this weekend
30% tariffs
on goods
from Mexico, 35% tariff
on goods from Canada
starting August 1st.
Canada, Mexico
are two of your state's
biggest trading partners.
Do you think
they will go into effect?
And what if they do?
What effect
that would have on
the businesses and consumers
in your state?
Yeah, both Canada
and Mexico aren't just,
the largest trading partners
for the state of California.
They're among the largest
trading partners
for the United
States of America.
And so let's remember
what happens
when tariffs take effect.
Those,
first of all, costs
will increase.
And the people who pay
that price increase
are United States consumers.
It's US companies
importing products
from those countries
that will pass along the cost
to the American consumer.
So in effect,
it's a tax increase
on the American people
brought to you by Donald Trump.
I do want to ask
about something
that is not just bubbling,
but kind of exploding within
the MAGA movement.
And that is
the Jeffrey Epstein case
specifically
the way the Trump
administration has handled it.
He the president's
defending the attorney general,
Pam Bondi,
after the DOJ
released a memo
saying that contrary to what
we've heard from them before,
that there is no so-called
Epstein client list.
You are on the committee
that oversees
the Department of Justice.
Are you going to push them
to overturn
any and all Epstein files?
So I think we have in the past,
but it wouldn't
be the first time.
There's a say
one thing to another
coming out of Donald Trump
saying one thing
on the campaign trail
and then once in office,
have a change of tune.
Unfortunately, it's
another sign of the chaos
and disorder
within the Trump
administration.
You have in the past, are you
I mean, are you interested
in seeing these files?
Is this
that's a priority
for Democrats?
I mean, I think it's,
the first question is
whether the
the list
they claim to exist exists.
You know, they can't have it
both ways.
Okay.
Senator,
thank you so much
for being here.
Appreciate it. Thank you. John."

#cnn #news #immigration","I am Garrett Graph. I'm a journalist and historian&nbsp;
and I write a newsletter called Doomsday Scenario&nbsp;&nbsp;
and host a history podcast called Long Shadow.&nbsp;
Okay. So, in the name there, you're really just&nbsp;&nbsp;
leaning in. You're not even pretending that this&nbsp;
is going to be a cheerful story. Yeah. All right.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, first let's just talk about how ICE started&nbsp;
because I understand it as something that was&nbsp;&nbsp;
sort of born out of the uh Department of Homeland&nbsp;
Security and 911 and that period where we were&nbsp;&nbsp;
really as a nation like launching new federal&nbsp;
agencies. Yeah. ICE was a creation uh alongside&nbsp;&nbsp;
as part of the Department of Homeland Security&nbsp;
right after 9/11. Uh, and it brought together two&nbsp;&nbsp;
different federal law enforcement agencies, the&nbsp;
inspectors of the US Customs Service, which were&nbsp;&nbsp;
then part of the Department of Treasury, and that&nbsp;
is now a division known as HSI, Homeland Security&nbsp;&nbsp;
Investigations, that focuses on uh drug smugglers,&nbsp;
human traffickers, uh, antique smuggling,&nbsp;&nbsp;
customs smuggling, nuclear, non-prololiferation.&nbsp;
They do really cool, really complex national&nbsp;&nbsp;
security cases. And then uh the other half of&nbsp;
ICE is what used to be known as the Immigration&nbsp;&nbsp;
and Naturalization Service, which was part of the&nbsp;
Justice Department. And that is uh now something&nbsp;&nbsp;
called ERO, Enforcement and Removal Operations.&nbsp;
And when we think of ICE, that's really what we're&nbsp;&nbsp;
thinking of is that half of ICE known as which&nbsp;
is ironic because the first thing you described,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, you're talking about nuclear weapons&nbsp;
and drug smuggling. That sounds like the more,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, uh, muscular version of it. You're&nbsp;
saying that's not the case. It's got this root&nbsp;&nbsp;
in kind of like paperwork people and inspectors.&nbsp;
Exactly. And there's this uh there's actually this&nbsp;&nbsp;
incredible tension within ICE between HSI and&nbsp;
ERRO. Um because HSI is sort of much more like&nbsp;&nbsp;
the FBI, the ATF, the Secret Service, sort of the&nbsp;
federal law enforcement that we normally think of&nbsp;&nbsp;
and those agents want absolutely nothing to&nbsp;
do with the immigration side of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Um in most cities actually there are separate HSI&nbsp;
field offices and erro offices because they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;
they don't even want to share offices. Um there's&nbsp;
so much sort of dislike between the two halves of&nbsp;&nbsp;
ICE. We have this alphabet soup of agencies. The&nbsp;
thing I want to underscore for people is that ICE&nbsp;&nbsp;
is about to get so much money that it doesn't&nbsp;
matter about those other agencies in a way,&nbsp;&nbsp;
right? like it is about to have a bigger budget&nbsp;
than just about any other law enforcement agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Um, am I describing that right? Yeah. Um, not&nbsp;
just like larger than almost any other federal&nbsp;&nbsp;
law enforcement agency, like larger than most&nbsp;
of them combined. Like if you took the FBI,&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh the ATF, the Secret Service, and the&nbsp;
Marshalss, um you know, threw in the DEA there,&nbsp;&nbsp;
um you still wouldn't get to the level of funding&nbsp;
that we are now giving to ICE over the next couple&nbsp;&nbsp;
of years with this new uh you know, explosion of&nbsp;
funding for immigration enforcement. I just want&nbsp;&nbsp;
to pause. That's wild. like that. That's crazy.&nbsp;
It It is. And And I think one of the things so,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, that money comes in a couple of&nbsp;
different buckets. It goes to hiring about&nbsp;&nbsp;
10,000 new ICE agents. Um there's money in there&nbsp;
also to hire about 3,000 new Customs and Border&nbsp;&nbsp;
Protection officers and agents. That's the&nbsp;
border patrol. That's the officers at US&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh border customs that you're sort&nbsp;
of used to in going through airports.&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh and uh building new detention facilities,&nbsp;
building new border infrastructure. Um but so&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's all you're paying for all your alligator&nbsp;
alcatrazes, right? There's money in there to kind&nbsp;&nbsp;
of encourage states to try to make up their&nbsp;
own popup temporary detention facilities. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're talking about when you talk about it being&nbsp;
bigger than all the other agencies, you're saying&nbsp;&nbsp;
all the money it'll have to do everything it&nbsp;
wants from the officers who pursue people to where&nbsp;&nbsp;
they put them, like the entire system is going to&nbsp;
grow. Yeah. Um, and to put this in like very frank&nbsp;&nbsp;
terms, uh, we are giving ICE, uh, about as much&nbsp;
money as we spend on the US Marines each year.
How much is that? About $50 billion a year. Okay,&nbsp;
still a lot. I just like needed some sense of&nbsp;&nbsp;
scale. Now, here's the thing. We're pouring this&nbsp;
money into an agency that is not that old. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;
ICE was created within my lifetime. That's&nbsp;
for sure. If we're talking about post 911,&nbsp;&nbsp;
how is it measure up as a quote unquote kind of&nbsp;
young agency? Yeah, I think actually a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the problems that we are seeing with ICE right&nbsp;
now stem from it being a very young agency in&nbsp;&nbsp;
the grand scheme of federal institutions. Uh and&nbsp;
what I mean by that is this is a agency that as&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was saying you know was created after 9/11. It&nbsp;
brought together sort of two pre-existing agencies&nbsp;&nbsp;
um but has had to build its own culture, its own&nbsp;
um you know sort of sense of self and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;
without you know without relitigating all of the&nbsp;
last 20 years of American immigration policy and&nbsp;&nbsp;
enforcement. Uh this was an agency that up&nbsp;
until you know six months ago or so was on&nbsp;&nbsp;
track towards being sort of an average federal&nbsp;
law enforcement agency. Um you know this was&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh you know it it had actually very good&nbsp;
directors and leadership in the Obama years. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, in the weird way of sort of our&nbsp;
national mental schism over immigration,&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh, Obama actually deported more people using ICE&nbsp;
than Bush did. I was thinking about ICE in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
context of other agencies because it's relatively&nbsp;
young. You know, if you think about the Justice&nbsp;&nbsp;
Department or Secret Service or Treasury, they&nbsp;
kind of have histories going pretty far back and&nbsp;&nbsp;
cultures that have grown out of various kind of&nbsp;
um law enforcement periods in our country. This&nbsp;&nbsp;
was in a way came into its own in just the last&nbsp;
couple of years. What makes ICE distinct in its&nbsp;&nbsp;
culture? Yeah. So, one of the challenges of ICE um&nbsp;
on the ERRO side, this enforcement uh immigration&nbsp;&nbsp;
enforcement side is this was already an agency&nbsp;
that had some of the lowest hiring standards,&nbsp;&nbsp;
lowest educational standards, and lowest training&nbsp;
standards of any federal law enforcement agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Certainly any of the big ones. Um to give&nbsp;
you sort of just a very specific example,&nbsp;&nbsp;
um to join the FBI, you have to have a college&nbsp;
degree. You have to also have professional&nbsp;&nbsp;
experience or an advanced degree, a law degree&nbsp;
or accounting degree. Um you uh you have to be&nbsp;&nbsp;
at least 23 years old. uh you have to pass a top&nbsp;
secret background check uh security clearance&nbsp;&nbsp;
check and then you undergo five months of uh 20&nbsp;
weeks of training. Uh ICE by comparison on the&nbsp;&nbsp;
erro side there is no educational requirement. Uh&nbsp;
you only have to pass a secret level which is a&nbsp;&nbsp;
lower level security clearance check. uh and then&nbsp;
you only go through uh sort of 12 or 13 weeks of&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh uh academy training before you go into your&nbsp;
work on the field. So these are so sorry you&nbsp;&nbsp;
said 12 or 13 weeks. Yes. And so this is an agency&nbsp;
that uh already has some of the lowest standards&nbsp;&nbsp;
for its officers in the US government. And what&nbsp;
worries me about all of this money that we are&nbsp;&nbsp;
throwing at the agency now is that in order to&nbsp;
grow at the scale and scope and speed that the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Trump administration hopes to grow it, 10,000 new&nbsp;
officers, 10,000 new officers, more than doubling&nbsp;&nbsp;
the number on the immigration side. uh they're&nbsp;
going to have to do what any agency does when it&nbsp;&nbsp;
hires in a surge uh like that and lower its hiring&nbsp;
standards, lower its training standards, and lower&nbsp;&nbsp;
its supervision standards. Okay, let me stick up&nbsp;
for ICE. What makes you think that that's where&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is going? Meaning there might be like right&nbsp;
now military recruiters are having a good time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
People are signing up to be in the military. What&nbsp;
is the reason why you think this is automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;
going to be uh in a way you're implying a lower&nbsp;
quality um batch of people who may be coming in&nbsp;&nbsp;
next? Yes. Uh it's a great question Audi and&nbsp;
the answer is uh every single agency that has&nbsp;&nbsp;
ever tried to do this in the entire history of&nbsp;
American criminal justice and American policing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
um that it's sort of well known in criminal&nbsp;
justice and policing worlds that a healthy law&nbsp;&nbsp;
enforcement agency cannot grow quickly. And uh to&nbsp;
be clear, and we can spend more time talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;
this, ICE is not a healthy law enforcement agency.&nbsp;
But when you look at the history, um anyone in&nbsp;&nbsp;
policing can rattle off the agencies that have&nbsp;
tried to grow quickly. Miami in the 1980s, the uh&nbsp;&nbsp;
infamous Metropolitan Police Department class of&nbsp;
1989 when Washington Mayor Mary and Barry tried to&nbsp;&nbsp;
grow the force by 50% in a single year. Um both of&nbsp;
those agencies saw enormous waves of criminality,&nbsp;&nbsp;
misconduct, and corruption. And then actually we&nbsp;
even have a more recent very clear example that&nbsp;&nbsp;
I spent years reporting on myself when I was&nbsp;
at Politico uh within DHS within ISIS sister&nbsp;&nbsp;
agency Customs and Border Protection where we did&nbsp;
a massive hiring surge um in the late 2000s under&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bush and Obama doubled the number of Border Patrol&nbsp;
agents from about 9,000 to 18,000 And the result&nbsp;&nbsp;
was sort of one of the most uh disruptive waves&nbsp;
of uh corruption and criminality and misconduct&nbsp;&nbsp;
we've ever seen in federal law enforcement. Yeah.&nbsp;
I think this is where we get that um for people&nbsp;&nbsp;
who do have some stigma about Customs and Border&nbsp;
Patrol who maybe look at that agency a little&nbsp;&nbsp;
different, it might kind of stem from this period&nbsp;
because even as a reporter, I remember a time when&nbsp;&nbsp;
there would be stories that would come out about&nbsp;
officers. Yep. So from during this hiring surge,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you saw the Border Patrol do exactly what every&nbsp;
agency has to do. They cut hiring standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They cut training standards. They cut oversight&nbsp;
and supervision standards because part of what&nbsp;&nbsp;
it it's not just about the new officers coming&nbsp;
in. It's also that you end up having to promote&nbsp;&nbsp;
existing officers sort of more quickly into&nbsp;
supervisory roles than they should or they are&nbsp;&nbsp;
experienced enough to do. And so to put sort of&nbsp;
some specific numbers on this, from 2005 to 2012,&nbsp;&nbsp;
more than 2,170 CBP officers and agents were&nbsp;
arrested for misconduct and corruption. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and to to make that clear, from 2005 to 2012, one&nbsp;
CBP officer or agent was arrested every single&nbsp;&nbsp;
day for misconduct, crimes, or corruption. And as&nbsp;
late as 2017, when I was still reporting on this,&nbsp;&nbsp;
that arrest pace had only slowed to one officer&nbsp;
or agent every 36 hours. Now remember this is&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is like this is a federal law enforcement&nbsp;
agency like this if anything this should be sort&nbsp;&nbsp;
of like less criminal than the average general&nbsp;
population and this is not anecdata right like&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is not you being like I've heard there were&nbsp;
problems of corruption it's like you could look&nbsp;&nbsp;
up arrest on arrest I don't know about all the&nbsp;
convictions but that's a lot of arrests I I went&nbsp;&nbsp;
to I I interviewed a CBP commissioner when&nbsp;
I was write writing about this for political&nbsp;&nbsp;
who told me on the record, we accidentally hired&nbsp;
cartel members. Um, like they were just not doing&nbsp;&nbsp;
the background vetting that they were supposed to.&nbsp;
They weren't doing the background investigations&nbsp;&nbsp;
that they were supposed to. They were not doing&nbsp;
the training that they were supposed to. And&nbsp;&nbsp;
then they were pushing these agents out into the&nbsp;
field before they were ready. They they actually&nbsp;&nbsp;
hired a serial killer. There was a border patrol&nbsp;
agent who was arrested for his serial murder,&nbsp;&nbsp;
rape, kidnapping, and murder of women in&nbsp;
Texas while he was a border patrol agent&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh a few years ago. I mean, this is just this is&nbsp;
a wild uh level of criminality. And I think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
actually exactly what we're about to experience&nbsp;
with ICE. Let me pause here because you you're&nbsp;&nbsp;
giving this example of Customs and Border Patrol,&nbsp;
which by the way, at the end of all that, they&nbsp;&nbsp;
hadn't solved the problem, so to speak, right?&nbsp;
Which is why we're in the position we're in now.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It didn't necessarily stop border crossings or&nbsp;
reduce border crossings. Those numbers go up and&nbsp;&nbsp;
down for all kinds of reasons. Walk me through how&nbsp;
and why this happens because you've given a couple&nbsp;&nbsp;
examples. It's not just something like Customs&nbsp;
Border Patrol, a big federal agency. it can happen&nbsp;&nbsp;
with a police force. You know, you mentioned&nbsp;
Miami in the 80s. What are the steps that uh&nbsp;&nbsp;
kind of lead us to those kinds of problems? Yeah.&nbsp;
So the challenge I is just the volume which is uh&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you know I'm picking sort of abstract numbers&nbsp;
here but if your goal this year is to hire 1,000&nbsp;&nbsp;
ICE officers, you're only going to take the 1,000&nbsp;
best applications you get this year. Um, if your&nbsp;&nbsp;
goal is to hire 10,000 ICE agents, you're going&nbsp;
to hire 9,000 ICE officers who would have not made&nbsp;&nbsp;
the cut this year. Why do you think that? Let me&nbsp;
stop because I feel like there's going to be some&nbsp;&nbsp;
ICE officers who hear that and are insulted. Help&nbsp;
me understand that sentence. ICE is going to get&nbsp;&nbsp;
the volume of applications that it gets this year.&nbsp;
Let's say it gets, again, I'm making these numbers&nbsp;&nbsp;
up. Let's say it gets 50,000 applications this&nbsp;
year. Um I in a normal year ICE might only hire,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, 1,000 new agents or officers to&nbsp;
replace people who are retiring, people who&nbsp;&nbsp;
are leaving early. Um you know, sort of turn over&nbsp;
the sort of normal number of slots. So of that,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, 40,000 50,000 applications, you're&nbsp;
only going to take that top 1,000 candidates. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
if your goal is to hire 10,000, you're going to&nbsp;
take 9,000 applications that you literally would&nbsp;&nbsp;
have turned down in a normal year. Um, who are&nbsp;
less qualified than the agents that you already&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh would have selected this year. And because&nbsp;
there's pressure to move quickly also, right,&nbsp;&nbsp;
wants to ramp this up, wants to spend the money.&nbsp;
Yep. and and you're going to sort of see that&nbsp;&nbsp;
ripple through the force because again there's&nbsp;
going to be a whole bunch of existing officers uh&nbsp;&nbsp;
in order to grow into that size who are going to&nbsp;
be promoted into supervisory roles uh who are more&nbsp;&nbsp;
junior than they would have been promoted into&nbsp;
those roles normally. um they will be stretched&nbsp;&nbsp;
sort of administrative capacitywise in terms&nbsp;
of the oversight of the new agents and officers&nbsp;&nbsp;
coming into the field. Um and you're also just not&nbsp;
going to have the sort of robust culture teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh that you would have in a normal more sedate and&nbsp;
uh ordinary hiring period. I mean, so much of law&nbsp;&nbsp;
enforcement um is like any other new company uh or&nbsp;
organization or institution that we're a part of,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is, you know, you're sort of learning on the&nbsp;
job, you're learning the culture, you're learning&nbsp;&nbsp;
what's right, you're learning what's wrong.&nbsp;
And when you're doing that with uh sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;
supervisors and bosses who have not learned the&nbsp;
ropes themselves, um you know, that's where you&nbsp;&nbsp;
end up having incredible culture problems, which&nbsp;
is part of what affected the Border Patrol during&nbsp;&nbsp;
its hiring surge as well that the um agency aimed&nbsp;
to have during its uh it sort of it's supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp;
have an agent to supervisor ratio of 5:1 during&nbsp;
the hiring surge uh that fell in some places to as&nbsp;&nbsp;
high as 11:1. So you had sort of the same number&nbsp;
of supervisors supervising more than twice as many&nbsp;&nbsp;
agents as they were supposed to. And by the end of&nbsp;
the Bush administration during the hiring surge,&nbsp;&nbsp;
more than half of the Border Patrol had been&nbsp;
in the Border Patrol for less than two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So that's something that I think we're going to&nbsp;
see a lot of with ICE where you know let's say&nbsp;&nbsp;
they're super successful with this hiring surge.&nbsp;
You know in 2 years from now um you know more&nbsp;&nbsp;
than 23 of ICE officers will have only been an ICE&nbsp;
officer for a year or two. It's funny. I went to&nbsp;&nbsp;
the ICE website to look at you know the videos and&nbsp;
things like that they might be putting out to draw&nbsp;&nbsp;
people. And the one that caught my eye was not the&nbsp;
one that was like images of people being arrested&nbsp;&nbsp;
and put on planes, which also was there. But&nbsp;
there was one person who was explaining, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's important for me to show that this job isn't&nbsp;
all just like arresting people and taking them&nbsp;&nbsp;
from their families. And it reminded me that even&nbsp;
they know that that's what people think they do.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yeah. And that to me uh actually is the thing that&nbsp;
I most worry about with this hiring surge, which&nbsp;&nbsp;
is we have never in American law enforcement,&nbsp;
never in federal law enforcement seen a hiring&nbsp;&nbsp;
surge take place within an agency as polarizing&nbsp;
and partisan as ICE is today. So, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you look at that post 911 hiring surge, you&nbsp;
know, we put a lot of new agents into the FBI. We&nbsp;&nbsp;
put a lot of um, you know, we doubled the border&nbsp;
patrol. Um, you know, there were huge ramp ups in,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, programs like the air marshals, but the&nbsp;
hiring pitch for them, the recruitment pitch was&nbsp;&nbsp;
this deeply patriotic post 911, you know, agree or&nbsp;
disagree with it, whatever. But the pitch was, you&nbsp;&nbsp;
know, come be part of the first line of defense&nbsp;
against terrorists. You know, America, all of us,&nbsp;&nbsp;
all Americans, you know, we are, America was&nbsp;
attacked. you know, you are going to be part&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the elite counterterrorism forces that protect&nbsp;
American way of life. That is not the hiring pitch&nbsp;&nbsp;
that ICE is splashing across the front pages and&nbsp;
the TV uh channels of America right now. They are,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, you know, the photos, the stories, the&nbsp;
videos. Um, you know, I it it is I I think to be&nbsp;&nbsp;
very frank about it, a recruitment pitch for&nbsp;
all of America's worst bullies. Um, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it is uh you know, are you excited to dress&nbsp;
up like you are going to go take Fallujah in&nbsp;&nbsp;
tactical gear with long guns and masks and then&nbsp;
go raid a Home Depot parking lot? Um, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
are you interested in doing hand-to-hand combat&nbsp;
in courthouse uh hallways with Democratic members&nbsp;&nbsp;
of Congress? Um, are you excited to go, you&nbsp;
know, chase farm workers through fields, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, throwing tear gas canisters and&nbsp;
flashbang grenades. Um, you know, this is,&nbsp;&nbsp;
um, you know, there's like a, you know, I think a&nbsp;
level of sadism in the images that we are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;
out of ice right now that are going to recruit&nbsp;
exactly the wrong type of people to this job. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're talking about recruitment, you're also&nbsp;
describing news stories, right? Like so you're&nbsp;&nbsp;
saying just the way it is depicted in public is&nbsp;
the advertisement itself is the thing that is&nbsp;&nbsp;
going to help people decide is this something I&nbsp;
would want to do or not and maybe help people who&nbsp;&nbsp;
are more uh civil liberties minded uh maybe make&nbsp;
them feel like well maybe that's not the place for&nbsp;&nbsp;
me. Yeah. I mean and and by the way I think that&nbsp;
this is an explicit part of MAGA's hiring pitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Um, you know, when you So, you you think that&nbsp;
ICE wants those images out there? I I I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;
look at what DHS, look at what CBP, look at what&nbsp;
ICE is posting to social media. Um, you know, they&nbsp;&nbsp;
are posting uh these incredibly aggressive um, you&nbsp;
know, literally they posted a like skeleton meme&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh the other day about mass deportations. Um, you&nbsp;
know, look at the photo ops they're doing of DHS&nbsp;&nbsp;
Secretary Christy Gnome and Donald Trump and Ronda&nbsp;
Santis, you know, walking and laughing through&nbsp;&nbsp;
alligator Alcatraz. As so many people have said&nbsp;
uh about the Trump administration over the years,&nbsp;&nbsp;
like the cruelty is the point. I think the defense&nbsp;
from Tom Hman who is the border zar and the and&nbsp;&nbsp;
the person they put out frequently to talk about&nbsp;
these things is he has said uh and to to quote him&nbsp;&nbsp;
the rhetoric against the men and women of ICE is&nbsp;
skyrocketing. We have senators in Congress people&nbsp;&nbsp;
comparing ICE to Nazis. It's ridiculous. Um, and&nbsp;
he's also talked about this contributing to their&nbsp;&nbsp;
kind of amped up approach that they now have&nbsp;
to be defensive or fearful while they're doing&nbsp;&nbsp;
their jobs. Um, and I think my answer would be,&nbsp;
uh, ICE didn't have to do this up until 6 months&nbsp;&nbsp;
ago. Up until six months ago, they were they were&nbsp;
actually deporting more people than they are now.&nbsp;&nbsp;
um that this the the change has come because&nbsp;
of who who and where ICE is targeting. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is I think an important part of the&nbsp;
ICE story right now, which is, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Steven Miller went to ICE headquarters this spring&nbsp;
and demanded that they get to 3,000 arrests a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the um you know, that gives them sort of&nbsp;
in round numbers about a million a year. And&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, we were talking earlier about&nbsp;
how for most of its 20-year existence,&nbsp;&nbsp;
ICE has focused on again oversimplifying&nbsp;
this, the quote unquote actual criminals,&nbsp;&nbsp;
um that they've used prosecutorial discretion to&nbsp;
go after the the gang members, cartel members,&nbsp;&nbsp;
etc. If you're trying to arrest 3,000 people a&nbsp;
day, you have to go after America's grandmas. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, you have to round up people in Home&nbsp;
Depot parking lots. you have to round up people&nbsp;&nbsp;
at farms because the the work of going after the&nbsp;
targeted sort of bad criminals just takes too&nbsp;&nbsp;
long and takes easier to go after someone who has&nbsp;
you're saying a civil infraction and and not the&nbsp;&nbsp;
resources to run, right? Um than a cartel member&nbsp;
or someone who's made their life's work hiding&nbsp;&nbsp;
from law enforcement. Exactly. You're saying it's&nbsp;
just like lit a we should say in fairness border&nbsp;&nbsp;
apprehensions are down like those numbers are down&nbsp;
and so you have to look elsewhere to make those&nbsp;&nbsp;
apprehensions. Yes. And and this is where you&nbsp;
know the main shift in ICE has come is who they&nbsp;&nbsp;
are going after and you know and how they're doing&nbsp;
it right you like you were noting that even the&nbsp;&nbsp;
FBI like they have their their jackets and like&nbsp;
there's ways that we identify law enforcement even&nbsp;&nbsp;
when they're not in a uniform and ICE is again&nbsp;
shifting in its approach. Yes. And um you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
America has no tradition of masked law enforcement&nbsp;
um outside of um you know, a couple of small and&nbsp;&nbsp;
specific areas in you know, certain high-profile&nbsp;
SWAT raids or um undercover drug operations. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but you know, when the FBI shows up to raid your&nbsp;
office or your house, um, you know, they're not&nbsp;&nbsp;
wearing masks and they go out of their way to make&nbsp;
clear that they're the FBI wearing their big blue&nbsp;&nbsp;
FBI raid jackets. Um, ICE has gone in a totally&nbsp;
different direction in these last 6 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And you know, we're seeing them wear masks. And&nbsp;
you know, part of the reason that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Tom Hommans of the world say, well, you know,&nbsp;
ICE needs to be masked now is because what they're&nbsp;&nbsp;
doing is so controversial that they are being&nbsp;
sort of personally targeted and attacked. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which I think should tell you something about the&nbsp;
public support for the work that they're doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That like no federal law enforcement agency&nbsp;
in American history has ever done anything as&nbsp;&nbsp;
unpopular with the public as what ICE is doing&nbsp;
right now, which is saying something when you&nbsp;&nbsp;
think about US history. I I have covered the FBI&nbsp;
for 20 years and I even during desegregation like&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't know. Yeah. I mean like again like the US&nbsp;
marshals um and you know uh FBI agents protecting&nbsp;&nbsp;
civil rights uh marchers like didn't feel that&nbsp;
they needed to be masked. Um, you know, we we&nbsp;&nbsp;
associate masks in America with groups like the Ku&nbsp;
Klux Clan. And I think to be very frank that ICE&nbsp;&nbsp;
is trying to create a level of intimidation with&nbsp;
its masked uh enforcement uh efforts. uh that is&nbsp;&nbsp;
more akin to what we would expect with a secret&nbsp;
police in a totalitarian or authoritarian regime&nbsp;&nbsp;
overseas. And I should say right now the way ICE&nbsp;
is operating one one way or another we're hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;
about it through the court system. There have been&nbsp;
challenges. Um, and I know that again to quote Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hman, he was saying every ICE officer, you know,&nbsp;
they go through fourth amendment training every&nbsp;&nbsp;
six months. You know, they're reminded that&nbsp;
what they can do, what they can't do when it&nbsp;&nbsp;
comes to arrest or detention or questioning.&nbsp;
You know, he has gone out of his way to say,&nbsp;&nbsp;
look, they are well trained. that's in the back&nbsp;
of my mind in in the course of this discussion as&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're talking about what they're doing now and&nbsp;
what the next class will be doing going forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yeah. And I think part of what again what&nbsp;
makes ICE different is a it exists inside DHS&nbsp;&nbsp;
um rather than the Department of Justice. Um,&nbsp;
DHS is much less institutionally witted to the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Constitution and civil rights than the Department&nbsp;
of Justice is. Um, you know, the DHS secretary&nbsp;&nbsp;
is a policy position. It is not a law enforcement&nbsp;
position in the way that the attorney general is.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Um, and and that position theoretically,&nbsp;
maybe not in the current configuration,&nbsp;&nbsp;
keeps the White House at arm length. Yes. at&nbsp;
arms length, right? That says like we're here to&nbsp;&nbsp;
enforce the law. We're not here to be kind of an&nbsp;
arm of the government, so to speak. Exactly. And&nbsp;&nbsp;
um then within sort of the architecture of border&nbsp;
security and immigration enforcement, there's just&nbsp;&nbsp;
a very different relationship to the courts system&nbsp;
than what we are used to with uh you know the FBI,&nbsp;&nbsp;
ATF, DEA, Secret Service, Marshalss. um you know&nbsp;
they rely on different standards of evidence. They&nbsp;&nbsp;
they are not as closely tied to article 3 courts.&nbsp;
you know, they go through a separate immigration&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh judge system that is and immigrants have a&nbsp;
different set of rights. and immigrants have&nbsp;&nbsp;
a different set of rights. And particularly&nbsp;
within the border zone um where you have um&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know this sort of weird gray area in America&nbsp;
that extends 100 miles from any border which by&nbsp;&nbsp;
the time you factor in all of America's coastline&nbsp;
uh encompasses most of the places where most uh&nbsp;&nbsp;
Americans live. Um, and I think one of the things&nbsp;
that again concerns me about this surge that we&nbsp;&nbsp;
are seeing with ICE is this is going to bring ICE&nbsp;
into contact with Americans in a way that we are&nbsp;&nbsp;
unaccustomed to seeing federal law enforcement&nbsp;
in our daily lives. Um, you know, the FBI,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Secret Service, DEA are very small agencies&nbsp;
at the scale of the United States. And you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
most of us go all of our lives without having a&nbsp;
professional interaction with FBI, Secret Service,&nbsp;&nbsp;
ATF, DEA. It's like it's all on TV, right? Um,&nbsp;
this is going to this scale of what ICE is both&nbsp;&nbsp;
hiring to do and then hopes to do numbers-wise is&nbsp;
going to bring ICE into the interior of America&nbsp;&nbsp;
in a way that we have never seen federal law&nbsp;
enforcement be a daily presence in American lives&nbsp;&nbsp;
and communities sort of inside most of the United&nbsp;
States. you know that we are going to, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
quote unquote get used to seeing uh ICE, you know,&nbsp;
at the 7-Eleven, seeing ICE at the Home Depot,&nbsp;&nbsp;
seeing ICE um, you know, outside America's&nbsp;
schools and churches and uh workplaces in a way&nbsp;&nbsp;
that I think most Americans don't want federal law&nbsp;
enforcement to be that present in our daily lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yeah. And even in places that are not uh having&nbsp;
a riotous response, right, like in LA, um people&nbsp;&nbsp;
are unnerved by it. And the reason why I say this&nbsp;
is because like if I'm on Reddit or social media&nbsp;&nbsp;
or something, inevitably on the feed, there is a&nbsp;
video someone has sort of surreptitiously taken&nbsp;&nbsp;
of something they believe is an ICE raid or an ICE&nbsp;
arrest or a detention in their neighborhood, in a&nbsp;&nbsp;
parking lot. People are kind of filming it because&nbsp;
they're like, ""Can you believe this is happening?""&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yes. you know, or they think something's not&nbsp;
quite right and they have to kind of get it on the&nbsp;&nbsp;
record. And, you know, in the last few years with&nbsp;
Black Lives Matters, etc. There's been this sense&nbsp;&nbsp;
that if you film law enforcement while they're&nbsp;
doing things, um, that that may, uh, come in handy&nbsp;&nbsp;
later, if you have to compare, um, descriptions of&nbsp;
the incident, but I bring it up because it speaks&nbsp;&nbsp;
to that sense of people being like, ""What is this?&nbsp;
Is this how this is supposed to go?"" And I think&nbsp;&nbsp;
we're going to feel it in the way that a lot of&nbsp;
Americans have to go about their lives, which is,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, already at the sort of tiny scale that&nbsp;
ICE is doing this across the country today. You&nbsp;&nbsp;
know, at a quarter or a third of what ICE will be&nbsp;
doing, they hope in a year or two years from now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, we're seeing US citizens get roughed&nbsp;
up. We're seeing US citizens, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
accidentally end up in these detention facilities.&nbsp;
We're seeing US citizens "
Oa0Xoix30C0,Stark split in where ICE makes arrests in blue states and red states,20250806,CNN,72269,"The Trump administration is apprehending hundreds of immigrants every day across the country – but there’s a stark split in where Immigration and Customs Enforcement makes those arrests in blue states and red states. In states that voted for President Donald Trump, ICE agents are far more likely to arrest immigrants directly from prisons and jails, a CNN analysis of data from the agency found. In Democratic-leaning states, by contrast, ICE is frequently arresting immigrants from worksites, streets and mass roundups that have sparked protests and intense backlash in cities such as Los Angeles. Most of those arrested don’t have any criminal record.

CNN's Boris Sanchez speaks with former Trump administration acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf. #CNN #News","CNN has learned that
the Trump administration
is now debating
whether to release
a transcript of the Justice
Department's recent interview
with her.
According to three senior
administration officials,
the DOJ has an audio recording
and a transcript
compiled from her
two day meeting last month
with Deputy Attorney
General Todd Blanch.
CNN's Paula Reid joins us now.
So, Paula,
what more are you learning
about these discussions
over at the white House?
So, Boris, news of this
audio recording
and the fact that
there are discussions
about possibly
releasing a transcript,
this all comes
as the administration
continues to face criticism
for backtracking on its promise
to be more transparent
with the evidence
it has in his possession.
And the reason
this particular audio
recording is
so significant, it's
because the administration
has not really given us
many details at all
about what Maxwell said
in her
roughly ten hour interview
with the deputy
attorney general.
Now it's really notable,
and in the course
of our reporting,
we were a little surprised
that a full audio
recording was made
and not the usual
just sort of summary
of the interview,
because this is someone
who is a convicted
sex trafficker.
Her credibility
has been questioned
in the past.
She's also been in prison
for several years,
which doesn't
really help anyone's,
mental state.
So now we are told
that there are discussions
about whether
they should release this.
Now, if this transcript
were to be released,
any sensitive information,
particularly information
about victims,
would have to be redacted.
But as of now,
we are told
no final
decision has been made.
But now that me or colleague
Alayna Treene
and Kristen Holmes
have reported the existence
of this audio,
and this transcript is unlikely
that the pressure
is going
to let up
on the administration
over its lack of transparency
over this evidence.
And, Paula, we understand that.
We just learned Ghislaine
Maxwell is now pushing back
against the DOJ's
effort to unseal
grand jury testimony.
What is she saying that.
That's right here.
This is the Justice
Department's request
to unseal
grand jury transcripts.
They made this request
in Florida
and New York
for the Grand juries
and investigated
Jeffrey Epstein.
Florida judge
denied the request.
But in New York,
the judge has opened
the discussion up
to other parties
who could be impacted
by this victims
and Maxwell to weigh in here.
And Maxwell's lawyer
had previously signaled
that they would oppose this.
But here,
in his filing to the court
a short time ago,
they expanded
on their reasoning,
writing, quote,
Of course,
they're referring to the fact
that she is appealing
her case to the Supreme Court.
But we're also hearing
from victims.
And it's really interesting
because the victims
we've heard from so far,
they are not opposing
the release of this material.
In fact,
they are pushing
for more transparency
as long as, you know,
they protect victims.
But really,
what they're asking for
is a chance to be able
to move on and begin healing.
And they have
until the end of the day today
to weigh in.
Paula Reid,
thank you so much for that
reporting, Brianna.
Today, the House Oversight
Committee issued
nearly a dozen subpoenas
for information
related to Jeffrey Epstein.
The committee is
Republican led,
but this is a bipartisan effort
that was initiated
by Democrats.
The committee's subpoena
to the Justice
Department demands
that it provide
any Epstein files
in its possession,
with the victims
names redacted.
The committee also wants
to see communications
between former Biden
administration officials
and the DOJ related
to the Epstein case.
The oversight panel
also subpoenaed
six former attorneys
general closed door depositions
in the coming months.
And it's seeking,
as well, depositions
from former president
Bill Clinton
and former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton,
along with former FBI directors
Jim Comey and Robert Mueller.
With us now
is Democratic Congressman
Robert Garcia of California.
He's the ranking member
on the House
Oversight Committee.
Congressman,
thank you for being with us.
And as we're looking
here at oversight,
subpoenaing DOJ
for the Epstein files.
Do you expect DOJ to comply?
And what do you think
will be redacted
besides victims names?
Well, first, we're obviously
very supportive
and glad
that the actual subpoena
was actually out today.
This is something, of course,
that Democrats forced a vote on
just a couple weeks ago.
And we had the
bipartisan support
of a few Republicans
coming over
and essentially voting
for for our motion.
What's really important
is that Chairman
Comer, in conversations
with us, made it clear
that we want these
files immediately.
So the DOJ has now two weeks
to send over.
It's not just files,
it's documents. It's videos.
It's other materials.
The DOJ needs to comply
with the subpoena.
We expect this subpoena
to be complied to.
That is in the law.
And so
we're expecting
a response from them very soon.
This is a win
for the American public.
That and transparency.
And most importantly,
this is important to center
the victims
and to get justice for them.
Now as it relates
to redactions.
We've been clear
that our focus is to protect
the actual victims.
And so, of course,
there has to be redactions
to protect the young women
and girls
who have been victimized
and sexually trafficked
in horrific ways.
That's got to be the center.
But what we should not be doing
is protecting anyone else.
We should not be
protecting anyone
that preyed on these women.
We should not be protecting
anyone that is powerful
or wealthy,
or Donald Trump or anyone else
that may be in the files.
And we know the president
is listed in those files,
because it's been reported
that the DOJ has told them that
in just the last,
last month or two.
And so
all of that is developing.
Now we're going
to get these files
and get transparency
for the victims.
We should note he's
not been linked to wrongdoing.
You mentioned videos.
What videos?
We understand
that the Department of Justice
and the Epstein files.
It's not just paper documents.
It's paper documents.
What you're saying
I'm asking,
are you talking about
videos of victims
being victimized?
We don't we don't know which.
We're actually in the videos.
What's important
is whatever is sent over that,
of course,
that victims are centered
and that that's all redacted.
We do not
and are not interested.
And anything
that harms victims,
that is not
we want to ensure that
the victims privacy
and the horrible trauma
they've already been.
What does that not
what does that
what does that look like?
What does that redaction
look like?
Does that look like
not getting the video
or does that
look like something
being blurred out?
I mean,
what does
that look like to you
when you're talking about
a redaction video?
So the negotiation
of that piece is not it's
not finished,
to be quite frank.
I mean, we have
we just got the subpoena out.
We want to our request from
Democrats has been very clear,
which is we do not want to read
to retraumatize
my heroes
who have suffered at the.
I think
that's the most important thing
to us.
Okay.
So oversight like will be
we'll be a very.
So you've
you've issued the committees,
issued nearly a dozen subpoenas
to all these
high profile figures,
Democrats, Republicans
for files
and information
related to Epstein.
this includes,
of course, former
FBI directors.
This includes the Clintons.
How much of those depositions,
are going to be about Epstein?
How much
are going
to be aboutrillionussia,
considering
the attorney general
has ordered prosecutors
to start a grand jury probe
into Obama officials over that?
Right.
I mean, look, I
mean, voted
and they want to expand
to a variety of folks,
as you just mentioned,
and bring those subpoenas
in and get depositions.
They can they
they're in the majority.
They can
bring depositions, subpoenas
for whoever they want.
That's fine.
What we want is
we want to get the
files themselves
and ensure
that we get
that information out
and make it transparent
to the public.
They're going to,
of course,
try to insert politics
and expand this in any way
that protects Donald Trump.
It's very clear from day one
that the White House
is involved
in some type of cover up.
Entire campaign
and talk about
releasing the files.
And then when he has the power
to do so, chooses not to do so.
We didn't have to
issue the subpoena.
He could have
actually sent out
the files on his own
and met his own
campaign promise.
He chose not to do so.
So we absolutely expect him
to continue
to try to play games
like he's done
with moving this Maxwell
to a different prisoner,
perhaps trying to work
on some kind of pardon,
or less sentencing.
All of those issues
that should concern us.
Donald Trump
is clearly going
to do everything he can
to minimize the impact to him.
But yet he's involved
in the cover up.
And we believe Republicans
are helping in that.
Right now.
Well,
let me ask you about this.
Want to make sure
we get the actual facts?
The Trump administration
is considering
releasing a transcript
of this Maxwell interview
that she did over two days
with the deputy, A.G.
Todd Blanche,
who was formerly
personal lawyer
to President Trump.
Do you want that released?
Absolutely.
I think it should be released.
But I think
two things are important.
I mean, one is
everything should be released.
It shouldn't be segments
of those interviews.
The entire transcript or video,
whatever is available
should be released
to the public.
But let's also make something
very clear.
The person that was handling
that deposition
was Donald Trump's
former personal lawyer.
I mean, this deputy A.G.
that folks are talking about
was the president.
I just said that
just to make sure
I know we're clear on that,
but I have limited time,
which is why
I want to ask you about this.
You said it should be released.
Victims names,
names of those accused
when you're
talking about things
should be released.
I mean, released
with redactions, though,
I assume.
Like, what are you looking for?
What concerns you have?"
AdOQQswrMoc,Smerconish asks Border Patrol sector chief why Home Depot was chosen for ICE raid,20250809,CNN,227329,Federal agents targeted a Home Depot near Los Angeles in an immigration raid that led to 16 arrests despite a court’s temporary order blocking the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in southern California. CNN’s Michael Smerconish asks Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg Bovino about the raid that’s ignited legal and political backlash. #CNN #News,"It was called
Operation Trojan Horse.
On Wednesday,
a man in a Penske
truck pulled up to a Home
Depot in Westlake, California.
Day laborers hang out there.
He was offering work
as they gathered
near the truck.
Several Border Patrol
agents jumped out.
The workers scattered.
16 were arrested.
Many city leaders from Mayor
Karen Bass on down,
as well as advocates
for immigrants, were indignant.
They thought
such sweeps had ended due
to a July 11th temporary
restraining order from the U.S.
District Court.
It banned indiscriminate
immigration stops and arrests
on Fourth Amendment grounds.
The order had been upheld
earlier this week by the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Local authorities
were wondering
what legal steps to take next,
but as far as
the feds were concerned,
the raid was successful.
They were enforcing federal law
and would continue to do so.
Not that they didn't
care about the TRO.
On Thursday,
the Trump White House
petitioned the Supreme Court,
asking them to lift the ban
on roving patrols.
And before I forget to mention,
this, Penske truck rental
made clear
that they did not authorize
their vehicle
to be used in such a way.
It looks like the Trump
administration is involved
in yet another legal standoff.
Joining us now
is Gregory
Bovino, chief patrol
agent, El Centro Sector
at the U.S.
Customs and Border Protection.
Chief,
thank you for being here.
This is not the first time
that this particular Home Depot
has been the focus
of an enforcement action.
What is it
that is going on at Home
Depots generally
from your perspective?
Well, good morning, Michael,
and thanks for having me.
As,
as or any other location
here in Los Angeles.
What we're looking at
is targeted
enforcement efforts,
targeted enforcement
efforts against
known violators of title eight.
Title eight
are our immigration statutes,
our immigration laws.
So when individuals,
violate Title Eight,
especially those individuals
that may have criminal history,
significant criminal
histories, prior deports
or things like that,
we're going to go
after those folks.
And it doesn't matter
if it's at a Home Depot
or anywhere else.
We're going to go
after those folks.
And that's what we did
at this particular location,
as well as many other locations
throughout Los Angeles.
I read that TRO last night.
It says that you're not allowed
to rely on race,
ethnicity, accent,
location or type of work. So.
So what was the
reasonable suspicion
on which you were acting?
Sure.
Michael, the,
what we look at here
again, as I said,
prior criminal histories.
And if we know that someone
is an illegal alien,
then that's
not only reasonable suspicion,
that is probable cause.
So which is actually
a higher level
than reasonable suspicion.
So in looking at locations
throughout Los Angeles,
including that Home Depot,
we understand,
we knew that
there were individuals
that were in fact,
title eight violators.
In fact, several of them
at that Home Depot.
And it was proven right.
during that raid.
So that's
that's typically
what we look at
is that targeted enforcement?
Michael, we've got 40
plus teams
spread out across Los Angeles
conducting that title
eight mission.
And The Home Depot was one
of those 40 teams.
Chief, I want you to get
rid of the rapists
and the murderers
and the assaulters.
I'm not so sure
what to do about as
I like to put it, the short
order cook in New Jersey,
in Jersey City,
maybe it's like a
a hypothetical of mine.
Peggy Noonan,
not exactly a progressive.
She was a speechwriter
for Ronald Reagan
in the Wall Street Journal.
She wrote within the last week
the following.
I'm going to read it
aloud to you.
She was talking about
workplace enforcement.
I think the enforcement actions
at Home
Depots
comes under the same umbrella.
What do you say to
that mindset? That argument?
Sure.
Michael, I think
that again,
that's wishful
thinking at its very worst.
When we look
at some of the heinous,
heinous criminals
that we've apprehended
at Home Depots
throughout California,
I think it becomes evident
that we have a problem
in this country.
that stems from
that four years,
four plus years
and unmitigated
migration of illegal aliens
across that border.
Folks that were unvetted,
we don't know who
these individuals are,
but one thing we do know
is that they're walking
our streets with impunity.
Michael, there was,
an individual
that was apprehended here
just a few weeks ago
in front of a Home Depot
who was a child rapist. Would
Miss Noonan?
Would Miss Noonan
like that individual
to come into her house,
perhaps with her grandchildren,
if she has any.
No pain and pain.
Of course not.
So absolutely. No.
So we're going
after those individuals.
And let me finish here
is one of the things
that we're now finding.
Michael, is 30 to 40%
of the illegal aliens
that we apprehend
in these larger operations,
like you saw at Home
Depot,
have significant criminal
and or immigration history.
That's 30 to 40%.
And, Michael,
when I joined the Border Patrol
three decades ago,
that figure
was generally around 5%.
We offer him a large okay,
maybe 5% would have significant
criminal histories.
Okay.
But let me
let me respond to that.
Let me, let me
let me respond to that
because I want to address that.
And then you can have
the final word I promise.
So if 30 to 40%
have a serious rap sheet,
then the remaining
60 or 70% don't.
So I'm most concerned
about the person.
I'm not excusing it.
I just think that we need
to be practical.
I'm worried about,
yes, the person who came here
without playing by the rules,
they overstayed a visa
but have since proven
to be a solid individual.
They work, they have a family,
they pay taxes,
and they haven't broken
any other laws.
What are we going
to do about that case?
Because I don't want
to catch them all
under that one big net.
You get the final word.
Sure, Michael.
Thank you.
I enforce
federal immigration law.
And one of the things that
that we don't
talk about here are.
What about mom and pop
America
that are put out of business
because of people
that that
they may be hard workers,
but that doesn't negate
the law.
Hard work
does not negate the law.
If you
if you rob a bank
and you're a hard worker,
does that make it
okay to rob a bank?
Absolutely not.
So we have a lot of these folks
that are unlicensed,
unlicensed vendors.
We actually apprehended
several of those
at that Home Depot.
So immigration
is not a victimless crime.
It affects all of mom America.
And this the 30 or 40%.
We're definitely going
after those
that everyone else has to
do it right. If they don't,
then and we come
into contact with them,
we're going to arrest them.
And they have an out here.
Mike, it's called
the CBP home app.
Do it right.
We'll pay you $1,000
and a free plane ticket.
Fly home.
Do it right.
That's all we're asking here,
right?
And I looked at that, too.
But there's no assurance
as to how and when
and in what circumstances
you're going to
get to come back.
I promised you
you would be the final word.
I don't want to violate that,
chief, come back
on a different occasion,
because I really want
to continue this conversation,
and I thank you for being here
Hey, Catherine,
can you put up that image of
the guys
in the back
of the Penske truck?
If you have that handy?
And I hear the chief's point.
The Chiefs point is like home.
There it is.
We go to the Home Depot,
and we pop out of the back
of the Penske truck.
And if you don't know
everybody at home.
Home depots
in many parts of the country,
I know this from radio
listeners have become
gathering places
where day laborers go
and people show up
and they want to hire them,
you know, to
to do our jobs and work
and so forth.
So if that net is
is capturing
the 30%, who's got a serious
rap sheet, okay.
I'm concerned about
what about the person
who's also getting
caught in that Dragnet,
who doesn't have a significant
and doesn't have any rap sheet
other than the original sin?
We need a pathway
to citizenship,
or at least to a green card
that allows some of these folks
to stay here and work
and be good citizens."
AlRypvEB76Q,The number of ICE flights is skyrocketing — but the planes are harder than ever to track,20250814,CNN,341869,The Trump administration is making it harder to locate detainee flights. CNN’s René Marsh tracked one plane as it flew across the US. #CNN #News,"More than 30 migrants detainees,
handcuffed,
walk up the steps and get on board.
One, two, three.
Four more detainees.
You can tell that
their hands are restrained.
This is one of about 6000 Ice flights
since President Donald Trump took office.
We were able to find this plane here
in Richmond, Virginia,
but most of them are hidden
from the public and operating
with little transparency.
Virtually every Ice flight carrying
detainees blocks their tail numbers
from flight tracking websites,
making it
nearly impossible
for families and advocates
to find their loved ones
once they're in ice custody.
This is one of the tail numbers
that we think could possibly come here.
And right now it's in Youngstown.
Oh, look, I think it's taking off
because the altitude is is increasing.
Yeah.
We studied months of flight paths,
got a tail number
and made an educated guess
about which flight
would arrive in Richmond.
Then,
using a crowdsourced database
that monitors aircraft radio signals,
we track the suspected flight,
revealing every city and state
it stopped in within 24 hours.
This is the plane
we're tracking, a Boeing
737 operated by Eastern Air Express
with the tail number and 668 CP.
It has up to 148
economy seats,
a bathroom in the front and the back.
But it's unclear
how many people are on board
this flight or any other Ice flight.
Catching five one.
Continue on. Okay.
Tyson 51 is is this one right now?
That's the call sign
that they're using for this flight.
Many ice flights go by Tyson,
the same callsign used to identify
Trump's personal plane
after he was elected in 2016.
Here's the flight path.
It took on August
6th Ohio,
New York,
Pennsylvania to Louisiana,
back to Ohio, then
New York,
picking up and dropping off
detainees at every stop.
If it's actually coming to Virginia,
it should be here very soon.
It's on approach.
It's on approach right now.
Its altitude is like literally 50ft.
So over there. Over there.
All right, I think
I think that might be a this is a plane.
This is the plane that we've been
tracking all morning.
This is it.
And we just saw
like more than 30 detainees
handcuffed,
walk up their steps and get on board.
There's one, two, three,
four more detainees.
You can tell that
their hands are restrained.
Another, another one another.
Okay,
so they're unloading
another vehicle here.
Multiple detainees
walking up
to get on board
this Eastern Air Express flight.
The Trump administration
has used more than 70
airports across the country
for domestic shuttle flights so far,
moving Ice detainees
between detention centers
before deportation.
In the past three months,
the number of these flights spiked 90%
compared to the same time
period last year,
according to an immigrant rights group.
And that trend is expected to continue
after the Department of Homeland
Security recently
earmarked $14.4 billion for Ice flights.
We know that the tail number of a flight
that we've been tracking
today is N668 CP,
and we want to see
if this public tracking site
that gets its data
and information from the FAA
has any record of the flight.
Nothing comes up,
but we were able to track the flight
as it made its way back
to Alexandria, Louisiana, the busiest hub
for Ice deportation flights
at this point in the journey,
some of the first detainees on board
were possibly on this plane
handcuffed for nearly ten hours
as this Ice flight completes
its 24 hour
trip,
Louisiana is likely
the last stop in the U.S.
before the people on board are deported."
FRW0tO84whc,Kilmar Abrego Garcia fights ICE push to deport him to Uganda,20250825,CNN,57967,"Minutes after Kilmar Abrego Garcia was taken into custody by immigration officials in Baltimore on Monday, his attorneys filed a new lawsuit urging a federal judge to order his release and slow down his removal process so he can have a chance to challenge his potential deportation to Uganda. 

Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year, was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after turning himself in to a facility in Baltimore. #CNN #News","That was
Kilmer Abrego Garcia
turning himself in
to immigration
officials at an ice field office
in Baltimore just a few hours ago.
He and his wife shared a tearful goodbye,
and then Obregon
Garcia was quickly
taken into Ice custody.
Department of Homeland Security
says he's being processed
for deportation.
He spoke to the crowd of supporters
and protesters
beforehand through an interpreter,
to all the families
who have been separated,
or to all the families
who have been threatened
with family separation.
This administration has hit us hard.
But I want to tell you guys something.
God is with us
and God will never leave us.
God will bring justice
to all of the injustice
that we are suffering.
CNN's Priscilla
Alvarez is following
Abrego Garcia's case.
So Priscilla
Garcia's attorney suggested this morning
that they did not know
he was going to be arrested.
This morning,
and they were told
he was actually going to be interviewed
by Ice officials when they went there.
So so what happened?
Well, the intention was that
it was a mandatory check in
where an interview would happen.
But his attorney did expect
that it was possible
that he would be detained.
That is something that Trump
administration officials
have repeatedly said was an option
if and when he was released
from criminal custody,
which happened last Friday in Tennessee.
Now, I was there on the ground
and it all happened
really within an hour.
But Garcia, as you see there,
spoke to the crowd,
thanked his family
and community organizers
as well as religious leaders.
And then, embracing
his wife, went up to the federal building
along with his attorney,
where he turned himself
into Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Around 45 minutes later.
His attorney was the one
who departed the building
and said that
Garcia had been taken into custody.
Now the big question is
where will he be deported?
Well, in addition
to announcing to reporters
that he had been in
maintained in custody,
his attorney also said
that they filed a new lawsuit
challenging his detainment
and his detention.
I'm sorry.
And his deportation specifically where
so the Trump administration
had offered a plea deal for Garcia
to plead to federal charges,
carry out
his criminal sentence in the U.S.
and then be deported to Costa Rica.
If not, he would be deported
to Uganda, a country
with which he has no ties.
But an approach to administration
has been taking often
and sending deportees
to these far flung countries.
Now, the administration
similarly went on to say that
if he didn't again,
Uganda would be the option.
now the the attorneys are blocking
this potential deportation.
And this is how his attorney described
the predicament as it is
the fact that there,
holding, you know, Costa
Rica as a carrot and using Uganda
as a stick to try to coerce him
to to plead guilty to a crime
is such clear evidence
that they're weaponizing
the immigration system in a manner
that is completely unconstitutional.
All right.
Priscilla Alvarez,
thank you so much for that report.
My excellent and panel's
reporters are back here at the table.
So why is this, you know, so
why is the administration so gung ho
on this case?
I mean, the way they've handled
this has really been something to see.
Right?
Back in March, they admitted in court
that he was mistakenly deported.
One of their attorneys did,
the courts said needed to facilitate
the release of him from El Salvador
back to the United States.
And then,
begrudgingly,
he the administration ultimately did.
Now they're threatening
to send him to Uganda
if he does not agree to plead guilty to
a crime here.
They could say this
he can go to Costa Rica instead.
They don't want to do that.
But what is your insight
and what are you hearing from
your own sources
about why they have made this
a centerpiece
of their fight on immigration?
I mean, if you look at Donald Trump's
career in politics,
there's been a few prevailing mantras.
And one of them is don't admit mistakes.
Don't say you did something wrong.
He has almost never done so.
And so
with this case in particular,
it is the centerpiece of a larger policy,
a larger effort
led by Stephen Miller
and hard line
immigration, forces
within this administration
that want to try to deport
as many people as possible.
This was a talking point
for Trump in 2015, 2016,
and it has been a through line
to his entire political career,
and both in terms of his presidency
and with this case, they do not want to
show any sort of,
you know, care or
caution in terms of that.
They made a mistake.
That is not the
the belief of this administration.
And so they are trying to do
everything they can
to show that they are going to pursue
the most aggressive policy
as possible, in part
to protect the president's own image,
but also has
what they believe
is a deterrent to other people
to try to get them, not to come.
Yeah, I mean, in the past.
Yeah. And the politics are very clear.
That's obviously
been a key issue for Trump all along.
They believe it's a winning issue,
but it's having an impact
on communities as well.
This is what it's our reporters
at CNN here reported this weekend,
quoting the headline,
it's like one day
everyone left how immigration crackdowns
are reshaping America.
They quoted
someone who's a jewelry seller
saying, people are scared
of being arrested just for being outside.
There is always this tension,
this feeling that something could happen.
Yeah.
And that's the risk.
In addition to all the what,
was mentioned,
the risk of how it could
impact communities, the economy,
and the risk that it backfire,
as you mentioned,
also, for example,
that this was central
to Trump's campaign,
the attack on Democrats
is being focused on
them was also central.
But both his immigration message
and his anti-trans message
ultimately were packaged
as the economy,
that the Biden administration
is too focused on things
that are harmful to the economy.
And so the question is,
could these things now backfire on him?
Because people are saying,
actually, these crackdowns could be,
you know, the opposite.
They're not helping the economy.
The promises that Trump made aren't
coming to fruition.
And by the way, I also see him,
in his administration
taking people off the streets.
And that's not what I voted for.
And we've seen some evidence from voters,
that not all of these tactics, wear well.
So,
when the case was prominently in the news
in the spring, when,
as you acknowledge,
the administration
acknowledged in court
that they did this incorrectly,
the initial deportation
that that was not wearing well,
his immigration numbers
started going down.
Then after the L.A.
crackdown,
we saw some hit on his immigration
numbers as well.
And I think it's interesting
to tie back to our first segment
that when he talks about, DC
or taking on the city,
yes, he acknowledges
getting some bad guys out or like,
the attorney general did today
in the Oval Office.
That's not the president's focus on this.
He he's hammering other points.
He goes to the beautification.
He goes to,
making sure the city is more livable.
It's not just this
relentless focus
on an immigration crackdown,
which is clearly part
of what is going on
with the DC takeover as well.
And and I think that's
because he's aware,
while immigration is his life
force in American politics,
and it is an issue
that resonates for his base.
it when it when when he
oversteps it doesn't
necessarily service political interests.
Well and I think you see him
aware of that fact at times.
Very quickly before we get to
what Jeff
Delany was saying at the beginning,
the theme of this month
has been a lot of authoritarian stuff.
It is a question
of how much Americans
are willing to tolerate,
in that way, for all, whether it's
an immigration crackdown
or crime, whatever,
these are authoritarian moves,
there will be some appetite
for it for people, for some people.
And there may be some backlash
for other people.
That's what we, I,
we often see an administration comes
in, they tend to overreach.
But regardless of party
and the midterm elections,
they tend to get blown back
a bit by the voters.
But we'll see if that
ultimately happens next year."

1F6O_bqZgS0,Hundreds detained in massive ICE raid at Hyundai plant in Georgia,20250905,CNN,624544,"Hundreds of undocumented immigrants were apprehended during a sweeping immigration raid at a Georgia manufacturing facility Thursday, marking what appears to be one of the largest ICE raids at a single site in the 22-year history of the agency. 

About 450 people were apprehended as several law enforcement agencies descended on the Hyundai Metaplant site in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, officials said, in the latest example of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration at workplaces across the country. #CNN #News","We're following
a massive ice raid
at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.
Officials say roughly
450 undocumented
migrants were apprehended.
Now, Thursday's raid was carried out
by multiple state
and federal law enforcement
agencies, including Ice,
the FBI and the Georgia State Patrol.
I want to bring in CNN's Isabel
Rosales, who's been monitoring this.
So, Isabel,
what is the latest this morning?
Omar, good morning.
With more than 450 people
apprehended, this marks
what appears to be one of the largest
Ice raids
at a single site
in the 22 year history of this agency.
Now, here's what we know.
This happened at the Hyundai
Meta plant site.
This is in LaBelle, Georgia.
This is just 25 miles
or so west of Savannah.
And according to the Associated Press,
this raid stopped
construction of this factory.
That's being built to produce batteries
for electric vehicles.
The same site, the same project.
This was touted by Georgia's
Governor Brian Kemp,
who called it
the largest economic development
site in the state's history.
Now we have video
that we're showing
and pieces
here of mass
and arm agents there at the site
giving out orders
while officers raided the facility.
We can also see workers here in hard
hats and vests.
They were lined up as this was ongoing.
On site was Ice,
Georgia State Patrol, FBI, DEA, ATF,
they were executing a search warrant
that DHS says
is part of an ongoing
criminal investigation
into this, quote, allegations
of unlawful employment
practices and other
serious federal crimes.
They're saying that this sends
a clear and unequivocal message to that.
They're taking this very serious.
And here's the special agent in charge,
what he had to say about this raid.
We are making
many arrests of undocumented individuals.
We have encountered
many lawful employees, working
here, United States citizens and lawful
permanent residents.
And they are, of course, being released.
Meanwhile, Hyundai says it is cooperating
with law enforcement, saying this
we are committed to abiding by over
and immigration and regulations.
And meanwhile, Omar,
on the same day,
hundreds of miles away
in upstate New York,
another large raid at a work
site, dozens of workers
at a family owned plant
that makes nutrition bars
were also apprehended during an Ice raid.
A CNN affiliate,
STM, reports
that about 60 workers were detained.
New York's governor
condemned this raid, saying
it doesn't make their streets safer.
And the owner of that nutrition plant
told The New York Times
that the workers
had legal documentation
to work in the U.S.,
calling this ice raid a quote, overkill.
Omar, Isabel,
thank you for bringing us those details.
A scale of those raids
notable at the very at the very least."
wsnpSb9-VQc,South Korean president responds to Hyundai plant ICE raid,20250906,CNN,1519633,"A sprawling Hyundai manufacturing plant in a quiet southeast Georgia community became ground zero on Thursday for one of the most extensive immigration raids in recent US history. The operation, months in the making, ended with 475 arrests, most of them Korean nationals.

South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung told officials to take “all-out necessary measures” to support Korean nationals, Cho said following an emergency meeting in Seoul over the arrests.

“If necessary, I am prepared to personally travel to Washington, DC, to engage directly with US officials to resolve this matter,” Cho said.

The Korean Ambassador to the US and the Consul General in Atlanta had established an on-site response team that will “assess countermeasures, emphasizing the rights of our citizens and the economic activities of Korean businesses investing in the US must be protected from unfair violations,” Cho added.

CNN correspondents Rafael Romo and Mike Valerio report.

 #CNN #News","Workers at a Georgia
Hyundai plant describe
a chaotic scene
after an immigration
raid at the facility.
Federal authorities
say Thursday's raid
was the result of a months
long investigation
by several agencies.
The crackdown,
the largest so far on U.S.
work sites,
led to 475 arrests
of mostly Korean nationals.
Some of the workers
tried to flee.
As word of the raid spread.
CNN's Rafael
Romo is covering this story.
What more are you learning of?
What was really
a chaotic scene?
It was difficult
to find out details
about what actually transpired
the first couple of days,
but now we're hearing
from people and officials
exactly what happened.
And one of the things
that we have learned,
some of the details
that we have learned,
Fred, after the massive raid
conducted Thursday,
include that
officers spoke with each worker
one by one to determine
which were in the U.S.
legally
and allowing some to leave
while taking undocumented
immigrants into custody
by the time they were done
at 8 p.m.
on Thursday,
agents had arrested
475 people,
most of them Korean nationals,
making it the largest
sweep yet
in the current Trump
administration's
immigration crackdown
at American job sites.
CNN obtained a video
that shows a Homeland
Security Investigations
agent telling workers
to cease operations
immediately. Let's take a look.
We need construction
to cease immediately.
We need all work
to end on the site right now.
Shortly after the agents
arrived at the plant,
then workers realized
what was happening after word
spread across the property.
Chaos ensued,
with many workers
attempting to flee
and some even
running into a sewage
pond and others
hiding in air ducts.
A Homeland
Security Investigation
special agent described
how agents screened
each person
suspected of
being in the country illegally.
Some that illegally crossed
the border
into the United States,
some that came in through
visa waiver
and were prohibited
from working.
Some that had visas
and overstayed their visas,
and each individual
was questioned on their status.
Their documents were checked,
their backgrounds were checked.
In a statement
sent to CNN last night,
Hyundai said the following
regarding the immigration
raid in Georgia.
The company
also said that Hyundai has
zero tolerance
for those
who don't follow the law.
In an interview
with CNN, former
deputy Homeland
Security Secretary
under President
Trump, Ken Cuccinelli
said conducting this type of
raid is a major undertaking.
There's a lot of
work that
goes into
an operation of this scale
and of this depth, including,
investigate
by multiple agencies.
obviously
takes a lot
of investigative manpower.
And that's all going on
in parallel
with a whole bunch
of other investigation
sessions across the country.
The plant that was targeted
was built after Hyundai
announced an agreement
with the state of Georgia
in 2022 to build
what the company called
at the time,
the first dedicated,
fully
electrified vehicle and battery
manufacturing facilities
in the United States.
The plant
was projected to employ
8500 people once completed.
But as you heard a moment ago,
they were ordered
to stop all work.
So this delays operations
for sure.
All right, Rafael Romo,
thanks so much.
Good to see you.
All right.
The massive ICE raid
prompted a sharp response
from the South Korean
president.
CNN's Mike Valerio is in Seoul
with more on the reaction.
There.
Well, the headline
from here
is certainly
that South Korea's
President
Yong is getting involved
in this matter,
telling his officials
that, quote, all out
necessary measures
should be done
to support Korean nationals
in this matter
and to resolve it
as fast as possible.
Now, this split screen
from where
he was just about ten days ago
is certainly dramatic,
considering that he was
at the Oval Office
meeting with President Trump,
talking about a new investments
that South Korea
would make into a reality,
making American shipbuilding
again,
improving investments
in manufacturing
in the United States.
This battery factory,
run by Hyundai
as a joint venture
with the other
South Korean giant, LG,
is certainly part
of that narrative.
And now to see this operation,
the biggest of its kind,
taking in the second
Trump administration,
it is so striking
and has hit such
an emotional chord
with a multitude of people here
in South Korea
quite astounded
that not just 1 or 2
or a few dozen
South Koreans
have been detained
as part of this operation.
But more than 300
a number confirmed
by South Korea's
Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today.
along those lines,
the Minister of Foreign Affairs
has said that
if this situation
isn't resolved,
he could conceivably
go to Washington, DC,
saying in part,
quote, as we discuss
this issue further today,
we are also considering
dispatching a high level
official to the U.S.
to address the situation
if necessary.
I, meaning
the Foreign Minister,
and prepared to travel
to Washington, DC
personally to engage
directly with U.S.
officials
to resolve this matter.
Unclear at the moment
what,
if any, charges could be filed
will be filed,
and how long will it take
to release
all 300
plus of these South Korean
nationals?
Again, hitting
such a chord with people
halfway around the world?

UQpiDjI7rf0,South Korean workers detained by ICE return home after saga that has rattled close US friendship,20250912,CNN,429796,"More than 300 South Korean workers detained by immigration authorities in Georgia last week arrived home on Friday, marking the end of a saga that has stunned their nation and threatened to upend a close bilateral friendship between the US and South Korea.  #CNN #News","More than 300 South Korean nationals
detained in a US immigration
raid are now back home.
A special Korean
Air Charter flight
carried the workers back from the US.
They were detained
during an Ice raid at a plant
under construction
in the state of Georgia,
was being built as a joint venture
between South Korean
giants LG Energy Solution and Hyundai.
The raid triggered an outcry
from South Korea, a key U.S.
ally,
and raised questions
about foreign investments in the US.
CNN's Mike Valerio is live for us
at South Korea's
Incheon International Airport,
where, Mike,
so many families
of those returning home
surely must be relieved.
That's right.
Brian,
I think that could be the understatement
of the evening here in Asia.
And, you know, the sentiment
that so many of these families have is
if you were asked
to invest in arrest
and the threat of arrest
should not be part of that equation
of helping out an ally
like the United States
is being helped by South Korea
with its technology sector.
So we want to show you the video.
We'll have the control room
play it
with the additional note
that a lot of these images, Brian,
because of South Korean privacy
laws and out of request of the company
here, LG Energy Solution,
none of the people
you're about to see all three,
all 316 of them.
None of them have been charged
with a crime.
So with privacy protections
and just the outpouring of emotion,
the raw emotion,
that's why this video is being blurred.
So you see men
that are ranging mostly men
ranging from 20 into their 50s.
We're talking about
engineers, technicians, not with luggage
coming into Incheon
International Airport,
one of the gateways
to Seoul, South Korea,
but with clear plastic bags or mesh bags
with all their belongings
provided to them by the U.S. government.
Such a striking sight.
So now the question turns to
what are all these companies going to do,
Brian, that are here in South Korea
that have future projects
in the United States?
They do not want anything like this
happening to their employees.
The president of South Korea,
young, spoke
to some potential feelings of hesitation
that businesses might have.
Listen to what he said yesterday. Killed.
But he joins us
from the perspective of companies.
They will be concerned
about disadvantageous treatment
or facing difficulties
when they're building factories
in the United States.
That could probably have
a significant impact
on direct investment in the U.S.
in the future.
So let's go to the video
of another moment, an outcry of emotion.
It was a giant banner
almost twice as high
a tall as I am, about six foot
one inches.
It says, were friends, aren't we?
And it's somebody
who is supposedly depicted
as being from ice,
all in black
chains over
one shoulder, an assault
style weapon,
and a smiling Donald Trump face.
That is one of the myriad
strands of emotion
of how people are feeling
being treated
by an ally of the United States.
Like this.
With those indelible images, Brian
from Ice,
with people handcuffed, chains
around their waist.
So really the question is, what,
if anything, is going to change
about visas between the United States
and South Korea?
The South Korean
president yesterday has said
that there are movements to perhaps
add more visas
to heighten the visa quotas
that are between the United States
and South Korea right now, perhaps
have a new class of visa.
If a business is investing
in the United States,
they get another visa
that's been created to prevent
what we saw just a few days ago, Brian,
and we know that the U.S.
president
will be meeting with South Korea's
leader here in the coming weeks.
And I know that you will stay
on top of that
development as Trump tries to somehow
smooth over the situation so far.
Mike Valerio, for us in John
Airport in Seoul. Thank you."

an ice facility in Dallas.
At least one person is dead,
according to police.
And we are live
with the very latest.
Welcome to our viewers
in the United States
and around the world.
I'm Pamela Brown.
Wolf Blitzer
has the morning off
and you're
in the Situation Room.
This is CNN breaking news.
And we begin
with the breaking news.
A gunman opened fire
at an ice facility in Dallas,
killing at least one person
and wounded two.
Other
law enforcement officials
tell CNN that at least
two detainees were shot,
according to the deputy
director of Ice,
no Ice officers were injured
and the shooter is deceased.
We are told Ice employees,
civilians
and immigrant detainees
are among
those at that facility.
We are awaiting
news conference. Any moment.
And of course, we'll
bring that to you
as soon as it starts.
But let's go straight
to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez.
Priscilla, what is the latest?
Well, Pamela,
we're still gathering details
as to what exactly
unfolded here,
but we are learning
more from the Dallas police,
which moments ago
said what
transpired this morning
in a post on acts.
Let me read some
of that to you.
They said that they responded
at about 6:40 a.m.
to an assist officer
call at this facility.
They went on to say that
the preliminary
investigation determined
that a suspect
opened fire
at a government building
from an adjacent building,
and went on to say
that two people
were transported
to the hospital
with gunshot wounds,
as you mentioned,
one of whom died at the scene.
And the suspect
is to seize on the acting ice.
Director Todd Lyons on our air.
This morning,
saying that
the suspect
was dead
from a self-inflicted wound.
And what my sources tell me
is that at least two
detainees were shot
when this happened.
Now, just to give you
a little bit of context
as to what
the facility
is, this, Dallas,
ISIS, a city
is generally
a place
used to process detainees,
so they may be arrested by Ice,
taken to this facility
to be processed
where there are about 3 or 4
holding cell cells.
So generally
there are a few dozen
people at the facility
before they are
then transferred
to a detention center.
Now, we still do not know
the motive of this shooter.
We'll hopefully learn
more about that
in the forthcoming presser.
But what we do know
from Homeland
Security officials
is that no Ice agents or,
were shot or hurt
during this incident.
That's what they have
said so far.
But they are also highlighting
that there have been increased
assaults, attacks and threats,
on Ice personnel.
In fact,
this particular facility,
was the target of a bomb
threat in late August.
So the Department
of Homeland Security
similarly saying
that they do not have yet
a motive for this shooter,
but they are tying
this as well
to what
they have seen
across the country,
which is this increase
in, attacks
toward Ice personnel.
Take a listen to what
the acting Ice director had to
say about that this morning.
I've never seen threats
on law enforcement,
specifically ice increase
the way it is.
You know,
we're up over
1,000% assaults
on officers right now
and really just a lot of the
the talk that's out there,
a lot of the rhetoric
is just the violence
directed towards
law enforcement officers
just trying to do their job.
And we just keep
just keeping
seeing an increase.
Now again,
I want to stress
that the motive
here is unknown.
We're still trying
to gather details on that.
But what we do know
is that at least two of those
who were shot were detainees.
There have been injuries.
At least one person killed.
The shooter died
from a self-inflicted wound.
And according to the Department
of Homeland Security,
no Ice agents were shot or hurt
in this incident.
Will hopefully learn a lot more
in the press conference
in the minutes to come. Pamela.
All right.
I want to bring in
Charles Ramsey
for more on this.
I know, Charles,
we are expecting to hear from,
police there in Dallas.
There are still
a lot of questions.
We don't know a motive.
How are you looking at this?
What questions do you have?
Well, certainly, we'll
hopefully we'll get
a lot more information,
as the press
conference unfolds.
But right now,
behind the scenes,
what's going on?
The shooter is dead.
So they've either
already identified him
or they're in the process
of identifying
which will lead to
search warrants.
A look at his social
media footprint.
Did he leave anything behind?
Trying to determine motive?
We know we have one
dead, two detainees shot.
Was the intent
to shoot the detainees,
or was it to, shoot Ice agents?
I mean, we just don't know
whether or not
the deceased individual
was a detainee as well.
So there are an awful
lot of unanswered questions.
I'm sure the FBI
will be involved in this,
since it happened
at a federal, facility
along with the Dallas, PD.
So hopefully
we begin to get a picture
of what actually took place
once the,
press conference is completed.
And we should note that,
there has been an uptick
in attacks on, ice facilities.
Ice officials, in fact,
there has been over 800% spike,
when compared
to the previous year
in terms of
assaults on officers.
So you have that
plus the fact that this
same facility in Dallas
had been targeted
before with a bomb threat.
Are you surprised
a gunman was able to
to get there and get through
whatever security there
is and carry this out?
Well,
from what we know so far,
this is apparently a sniper.
I don't know how far away
the sniper was
from the facility itself.
The security
they had in place there,
and probably
at Ice facilities
and federal facilities
for that matter,
around the country,
basically protecting
the building itself,
in and around the building.
Which doesn't take
into account a sniper.
We don't know
how far the person was,
the kind of weapon
it was used, obviously.
Probably a rifle of some sort.
And, you know, in order to
make a shot.
But there are a lot
of unanswered questions.
But, yes,
I'm sure that,
security's been increased.
I mean,
this is very controversial.
So what Ice is doing right now,
but these officers are only
doing their jobs
and they're doing it
the direction of the president.
So, you know,
this is something
that's controversial and
and certainly,
unfortunately, not surprising
in the current environment
we find ourselves in today.
But it's unfortunate
someone lost their life.
Whoever that individual is.
And the vice president, J.D.
Vance, just tweeted out,
quote, the obsessive
attack on law enforcement,
particularly Ice, must stop.
I'm praying for everyone
hurt in this attack
and for their families.
Again, at this early stage
in the investigation,
officials are saying
that Ice officials were not,
injured in this.
We know that two were shot.
One, was killed.
So we're awaiting more details.
But given this
threat environment,
what should happen
moving forward
in terms of protecting,
as you said,
these Ice agents
who were just carrying out
orders from the president?
Well,
I'm sure there's going to be
a security assessment done
at all federal facilities.
But I would argue
it goes beyond,
federal facilities.
I mean, political
violence in general,
is taking place in our country.
And those high profile
individuals, elected
officials or federal,
employees and so forth
need to do a threat assessment
to make sure that they're
taking steps necessary
in order to secure themselves.
It won't be 100% foolproof,
but at least review
what you currently
are doing to see whether or not
there are additional steps,
whether you need drones to,
check rooftops
or whatever it might be.
I don't know the answer,
but I do know that
you do need to assess
where you are right now
and what you may need to do
in the future to do,
do all you can
to protect the people
who work in these facilities.
The gunman is dead,
according to officials.
So how does that complicate
this investigation in terms
of identifying a motive?
Well, I mean,
he probably left
something behind.
They've either already
identified this individual,
or they certainly
can identify them through
fingerprints and various
other means.
And they're going through
social media posts
or going through a vehicle.
If he drove a vehicle there
all these kinds of things
to try to uncover a motive.
Sometimes
you never do determine
a motive.
I think in this case,
you probably will.
He took his own life,
probably left something behind.
Some of these guys want,
you know, the world to know why
they did what they did.
Even though it may not
make a lot of sense to us,
to them, it makes sense.
And so,
I'd be surprised
if eventually
they don't uncover, a motive.
In this particular case.
Right.
And just to be clear, I'm
not sure if we've identified
whether the shooter is a male,
male or female.
So we're just waiting
for more details,
hopefully from police there.
And Dallas.
And as we await for,
you know, officials
to come and answer questions,
tell us a little bit more
about what
you would want to ask them
if you were there at
that press conference.
Well,
one question we just
talked about, and that is
do you have a motive?
Who is the shooter?
I mean,
do you have an idea
you're able to share
that information.
They may not be able to
because in the early stages
of an investigation,
even if you know who
the shooter is,
you want time to be able to,
not only see social media
and, and conduct
search warrants,
but you want to be able
to interview family, friends,
all those kinds of things.
And once that
name is out there,
it makes it even,
more difficult.
What kind of weapon,
did this individual,
use?
How far away was that person?
Do you believe
the target
was actually detainees,
or was he
actually shooting at Ice
agents?
Were the detainees outdoors
under what?
What were the circumstances
where they were exposed,
to sniper fire?
I mean, these are all things
that, you know,
I kind of want to know,
at this stage
in the investigation,
some of that information,
you'll be able to get
some of that.
You won't,
because it is in
the early stages.
But it's important
to get those answers
to protect
and address vulnerabilities
at these facilities. Right.
So Charles Ramsey,
thank you so much.
Alvarez. Thank you as well."

The children of this woman

essentially pleading
with this immigration officer
when you listen
and you watch that very disturbi

she is asking the officer
to take her instead.
And she's trying to explain to h

That's exactly
what unfolded
in immigration court
here in New York City yesterday.
And I think it's important
to just mention
that we are seeing incidents
like this one
almost on the daily
basis here in New York City,

including the Democratic mayoral

who just had a press conference
a short while ago,
standing with members
of the state Assembly
and the city comptroller,
Brad Lander,
who was there yesterday
when this incident unfolded.
And it's become essentially
a flashpoint
in the city's race for mayor.
He was critical

on some sort of modified duty.
He was relieved of his duties,

for the department, saying, quot
the officer's conduct in this vi

And beneath the men and of ice

It's also,
sort of interesting
to point out
that we have been seeing
so many of these types of videos
not just here in New York City,
but across the country
as the Trump administration ratc

And it's not very often that we
such a strong reaction
from the Department of Homeland
now saying that they are going
to investigate this incident,
here in New York.
We've also just learned
from the office
of Congressman Dan Goldman,
who has been witnessing
a lot of these interactions down
at the federal court in lower Ma

this incident
for federal prosecution to the U
Attorney's office.
So they also are calling

Yld-xOolu7U,What do Americans think of ICE? Harry Enten looks at polling,20250929,CNN,159070,"President Trump may deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon. CNN chief data analyst Harry Enten runs the numbers on how popular that move may be. CNN's Sara Sidner also speaks with Rep. Brad Schneider (D-IL) about the possibility of federal troops in Chicago, the possible government shutdown, and President Trump's Gaza peace plan. #CNN #News","All right.
The city of Portland,
the state of Oregon
suing the Trump administration
to block deployment of hundreds
of National Guard
troops to Portland.
The president
says he's doing it
to protect Ice facilities.
With us
now, CNN
chief data analyst Harry
Enten. The administration
clearly thinks this is
a winning issue
for them
as they keep on doing it
and leaning in.
One of the polls say,
yeah, this is fact check time.
You know, the idea,
oh, we're going to be
hawkish on crime.
We're going to be
hawkish on immigration.
It's good for us.
But in fact not necessarily.
What are we talking about here.
All right Trump
deploying national guards
to cities
in the United
States of America.
Look at this.
Just 42% of Americans
support that idea
of sending troops into cities
like Portland.
What about the opposition?
Look at this.
It's the lion's share.
58% oppose.
And we're talking about
64% of independents
who are opposed.
So if Donald Trump thinks
that potentially sending
in the National Guard
inner cities
like Portland is a winning
political issue.
The polling says,
you are wrong, Mr. President.
The most analogous situation
is what what happened
in Los Angeles? Correct.
What happened to the numbers
there after the president
did that then?
Yeah.
We've heard this music
before, right?
We've heard this song before.
And what happened
the last time that Trump sent
National Guards
in a Western city?
Well, take a look at the change
in Trump's net approval.
Overall,
it dropped four points.
How about on immigration,
which of course,
those protests were about?
Look at that.
It dropped by seven points.
So we have a history
of Donald Trump
sending the National Guard
into a western city.
And what happened
was there were clear
political ramifications
for the United States,
and they were not
good ramifications.
What happened
was his overall approval rating
dropped by four points,
and his immigration approval,
which had been his best issue
up to that point,
dropped by seven points,
went from net
positive territory
to net negative territory.
And in this case,
he says he's doing it
to protect Ice facilities.
Which brings us
to the issue of Ice in general.
What are opinions on on this?
Yeah.
So let's take a look
at Ice approval.
All right.
ISIS net popularity rating.
You know in Trump's first term
it was at zero points
not too great
but not too bad either.
But take a look.
Now look at this.
Immigration
and customs Enforcement
that agency look at that.
-14 points down
it goes
because of their actions
during the second Trump term.
In fact,
the Pew Research Center
pulled 16 different agencies.
ICE’s net popularity
rating was 15 out of 16.
It was close
to being the least popular
of all.
This bottom line is John,
the president may think this is
a politically winning
issue for him,
but the numbers tell
a very different story.
It's in fact a political loser.
Interesting.
All right, Harry,
and thank you.
Thank you, my friend Sarah.
All right.
Joining me
now is Congressman Brad
Schneider, Democrat
of Illinois.
Thank you so much
for being here.
You just heard that polling
Trump is
sending troops to Portland.
He's also just increased
the Ice presence
for raids in your state.
And he says he will send troops
to Chicago at some point,
although he had promised that
before
sending them to Portland
right after he sent troops
to Washington, D.C.,
how do you think
the state and local
government should respond?
Well, I think what we've seen
in Chicago, Illinois, is,
is the way
we need to address it.
The governor
has been very clear.
I ice is not welcome to do
what they're doing here.
They're literally going around
terrorizing our communities,
tackling people,
bringing them to the ground,
physical violence,
terrorizing communities,
not not keeping
the community safer,
but actually
making people scared
and frightened.
And with respect
to the National Guard,
the governor said
they're not needed here.
We've all been together
on this.
I visited,
Naval Station
Great Lakes with Senator
Durbin and Senator Duckworth,
to talk to the base,
making sure
that their mission of training
our sailors is protected
and not abused
by the president.
The bottom line
is, the president's
trying to provoke violence.
He's trying to
create a situation where he can
justify the actions
he wants to take.
It's a totalitarian,
totalitarian playbook
that we've seen
play out in other places,
and it has no
place here in America.
All right.
In less than 48 hours,
we could see a
federal government shut down.
If no agreement
is made to further
fund the government.
This today
will be the first time ever
that President
Trump will sit down with House
Democratic Minority
Leader Hakeem Jeffries.
What message do
your constituents
want Democratic leadership
to send?
My constituents
around the district, this week,
all weekend,
they're saying the same thing.
We need to stand up
to the president.
The president is trying
to usurp
the authority of Congress.
He's trying to
take away programs
that Congress
Congress has authorized,
and that the people
in our communities,
depend upon. And,
you open with question,
you open the question
with the key point.
This is the first time,
nine months
into this administration,
it's the first time
that the president
is meeting
with Democratic leadership.
He's made it clear
he doesn't want to work
with the Democrats.
He isn't willing to work
with the Democrats.
And any deal
he would make
with the Democrats.
He's demonstrated
time and again
that he's not going to honor.
So the,
our caucus is standing strong.
We are protecting the health
care of the American people.
We're working to lower costs
of living for
the American people.
We're going to fight to protect
the interests
of the American people.
Let me ask you this,
because there's a
threat out there from President
Trump that if Democrats
don't vote to help Republicans,
at least seven
Democrats have to vote
to help pass
this continuing resolution.
Then the president says
he's going to do this.
Mass firings,
permanent firings
of more federal workers.
You know,
President Trump and Republicans
have been clear that they want
a smaller federal government.
Does this put Democrats in
a lose lose position here?
That the only people losing
are the American people?
The president has been
firing federal workers
since the day he took office
last January,
and they've been going after,
department after department.
The courts have, questioned
some of those or
or stopped
some of those
and others, they,
they haven't put a
restraining order
but said that they have,
concerns and are can
they hear the cases?
We have seen in departments
like the VA and others
where, the administration
has fired people, realize
those people are necessary
to do the work
the American public,
deserves and demands
that they are rushing to try
to rehire those people.
Earlier in the show,
you talked about the hurricanes
in the in the Atlantic Ocean.
The president's been cutting
the weather service
that helps predict and
and protect Americans,
and anticipating hurricanes.
There are so many departments
that this administration
has diminished.
They've done it with,
the government funded.
They'll continue to do it if,
Republicans who
control the House
and the Senate
aren't able to get the votes
to fund the government now.
But the Republicans
control everything.
They have the House,
the Senate and the white House.
They can't do it alone
if they need the Democrats.
We're willing
to work with them.
We want to work with them,
but we're not going to just
lay down
and let them walk all over us.
You're co-chair of the House
Foreign Affairs
Committee and co-founder
of the Abraham Accords caucus.
Do you have any issues
with the 21 point
Gaza ceasefire
that Trump is putting forth?
And he will be talking
to the Israeli prime
minister today about it.
What's your concern?
Well,
let's talk
about possibilities first.
I pray
we all want this war to end.
We want the hostages home.
Tomorrow. Today.
And and we want
the people of Gaza to be able
to build a future
free from Hamas.
There will never be peace
for the people of Gaza,
the people of Israel,
the region.
As long as Hamas controls
Gaza and threatens
the annihilation of Israel.
So this proposal,
the 21 points,
there's a lot in there
that offers
hope for both sides.
It's not fully
completed.
There's a lot of details
that need to come out.
The devil's always
in the details, but,
I hope that the president
and Prime Minister Netanyahu,
can have
a constructive conversation
that continues
the possibilities.
That's why I'm so excited
about the Abraham Accords.
Proud to chair
the Abraham Accords caucus.
It sees a different vision
for the Middle East,
where Israelis and Palestinians
and all the people
of the region
live together in peace,
recognizing each other's,
presence and the fact that
the land belongs
or actually the people belong
to the land.
Both Israelis and Palestinians
belong to the same land.
And by embracing each other,
looking to a future together,
they can not only
lift up each other,
but they can lift
up the whole region.
All right.
Lots of dreams there.
The reality much harder.
We will see what
the details are.
Congressman Brad Schneider,
thank you so
much for coming on."
4sIfa2qjXNc,"ICE's Chicago raid: Black Hawk helicopters, flashbangs, kids in zip ties",20251004,CNN,518387,"Adults and children alike were pulled from their Chicago apartments, crying and screaming, during a large overnight raid that has left tenants and neighbors shaken. All were part of a multiagency operation that led to the arrest of 37 undocumented immigrants, most of them from Venezuela but also including people from Mexico, Nigeria and Colombia, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN. In the past weeks, federal agents have been deployed on the streets of Chicago and have arrested more than 800 undocumented immigrants since September 8 during what the administration has titled “Operation Midway Blitz,” according to a news release from DHS. Tenants said it appears everyone in the building was detained by federal officers, including US citizens.

In an animated debate, CNN's Abby Phillip discusses with her ""Table for Five"" panel: podcast co-host Van Lathan, former New Hampshire GOP Congressional candidate Gail Huff Brown, CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings and CNN political commentator Ashley Allison. #CNN #News","Donald Trump wanted American
cities to be training grounds.
And ICE listened. In Chicago
in the middle of the night.
Federal agents
stormed an apartment building.
Black Hawk helicopters
flash bangs,
military style trucks,
all used in the raid.
Now, witnesses say
everyone was detained,
no matter their status.
Children were zip
tied together, separated
from their parents.
And the feds say
that they arrested
dozens of gang members
also in the city.
Charlie Kirk's group
was given a front row seat
to a raid inside a Walmart.
Amazing. Secretary
Noem was here.
They rolled up
a couple of guys
and it's rowdy.
And there were a lot.
There's a lot of people around.
Everyone's filming.
The secretary of Homeland
Security is right now
doing raids at Walmart.
So as
forewarned, I
mean, we have a situation
in which American cities
are at the center
of this ice
crackdown,
and there's indiscriminate,
use of force against Americans,
non-Americans, people here
legally, people here illegally.
And on the right.
Nobody seems to care.
In fact, they love it.
I saw a video
from a local station
in Chicago,
and residents of a community
there were describing
an ice raid and, like,
what they saw.
Two things struck me.
One,
they were talking about things
that happened to them.
They were talking about
how they were treated
in this ice. Right.
These are the people that
I guess, by virtue
of being born here in America,
are entitled to being treated
like human beings.
The second thing is
that they were all black.
And I'm going to say something.
We saw this coming.
We knew the neighborhoods
where these Ice raids
would take place.
We knew
that a lot of these things
wouldn't happen
in Beverly Hills
or in Coconut Grove
or any of those places
like that.
We knew that
there would be
collateral damage,
that there would be trauma
that would be inflicted
on our communities.
We knew that
people would be
detained scared.
We knew the children
would have to see things
that they shouldn't
have to see.
And all of this
for political theater
so that we looked tough,
tough on immigration
for everyone.
It's a horror show.
And I do think if
if it hasn't already happened,
that it will be something that
even the most conservative
of Americans will get tired
of seeing human beings
treated this way.
At least that's my hope.
The, one neighbor
said that the kids were crying.
They looked very.
I was out there crying.
When I see
you seen the little girl
come around the corner
because they were bringing
kids down to have them
zip tied to each other.
Saying that there were trucks,
military style vans
used to separate
adults from kids.
What's going on?
I haven't seen any of this,
so I.
And I certainly,
am not aware
of particular neighborhoods
that are targeted.
Obviously, I support them
finding and arresting,
people who are here illegally.
And in the community
they're in, again,
I, I can't justify
I haven't seen
which communities
that they're targeting
this one
until it's been left out
is that they were targeting
Tren de Aragua.
And so Tren de
Aragua is a violent
transnational gang.
They send illegal immigrants
here to the United States.
They trafficked drugs.
They trafficked people.
They commit violence,
they inflict misery everywhere
they go.
And 37 people were arrested.
That was the
purpose of the raid,
the targeting of Tren de Aragua,
some of the most violent people
in our hemisphere.
And when they come here,
nothing good happens that way.
Okay. So.
So if it was targeting,
I don't think anybody has
a problem with targeting.
When you clear out
an apartment for children
and you tie children,
and you arrest
and detain everyone.
Hold on, hold on. Scott.
You and me, we're talking here.
Okay?
If they arrest children,
they arrest everyone.
Citizens and non-citizens
for hours.
Detain them,
deprive them
of their liberties.
No matter how long you are,
fine with that.
They didn't arrest children,
but I didn't say
they arrested them.
They put them in zip ties.
But if that makes a difference
to you, go ahead.
Here's
what makes a difference to me.
If the federal government
knows that there is
a nest of trendy arugula
in a city like Chicago,
they have a responsibility.
They have an obligation to go
get them.
It is unfortunate.
To answer your question,
that there are children
put in harm's way
by these violent gangs,
but that is not gonna be
the reality of the violence.
It's an unfortunate
violation of their rights,
is the question,
because, I mean,
in this country,
we have rights against.
You're suggesting
these children shouldn't
be effectively advocating
for arrived when?
I don't know what I'm asking.
Hold on.
I want to make it clear
I don't like
I know that trendy
arugula and gangs
and whatever, it's a catch
all to treat people
however you want to go in there
and shred the Constitution
or whatever else it is
that you want to do.
What I'm asking you is this
do you think that children
should have been
zip tied
and pulled out of an apartment
complex and traumatized
like that? Yes or no?
I don't think children
should be put in harm's way
by transnational gangs.
Just answer the question.
Yes or no?
Do you think they're children?
I feel like I'm not.
I don't accept
the premise of your question.
Asking the government
whether or not you're in
harm's way.
Tren de Aragua.
Real calm now.
Real calm. Like the other ones.
Gentleman.
The gentleman.
We have a responsibility
for the way
we treat people
with the power
that we have here in America.
And we have a standard
that we should
treat human life with.
And I'm asking you
very clearly,
concisely,
should children
be treated like, wait,
the Scott Jennings like that?
I don't accept
the premise of your question.
I don't believe,
I don't believe
that the premise
of your question is accurate.
I would ask you back
should children
be allowed to live
in an apartment building
with trend arugula?
Should the entire
community of Chicago
have to live with their rod
because they hide behind it?
Well, here's the thing.
That's my question.
The answer to that is clear.
No,
they should not be
put in harm's way.
But the difference is,
when this situation is
I don't want to be Tren de
Aragua.
I don't want my law enforcement
to act like Tren de Aragua.
That is the distinction.
You don't want to do.
You just want to leave it
and say, well,
I have kids in there.
Let's just move on.
No, you can't
we can't can't law enforcement
figure out a way?
I don't think this is
the first time
children have been
in an environment
where dangerous people
have been around them,
and I'm
almost certain
that in most of
those circumstances,
those children aren't zip
tied and carried out
like animals.
What I am wondering is,
okay,
let's put this
fact pattern
on any other placement.
Let's put it on
a school, right?
What if there was
a gang member in a school?
And by this calculation,
it would seem like the children
in the school,
in order to get that one
gang member
or two gang members.
But again,
it's not one gang
member, it's 37.
Let's say.
Let's say
it's a large apartment.
That's part of that's
part of the fact pattern here.
I mean, here's another one.
From from our reporting,
tenants said it appears
everyone in the building
was detained
by federal officers,
including U.S. citizens.
It was scary, said one,
because I had never had a gun
in my face.
That person lives
in the building.
They asked my name
and my date of birth
and asked me,
did I have any warrants?
I told them, no, I didn't.
Fisher the this,
this person says
she was handcuffed anyway
before being released
around 3 a.m.
and was told anyone
with outstanding warrants,
even if it was unrelated
to immigration,
would not be released.
So in the again,
like like serial
live in apartment buildings
all over this country.
It's a promise
that work is work
is that we're going to say,
what's wrong?
Should I just go
to an apartment building?
And how sweet.
I'm talking about the way
that citizen of this country
was treated.
By the way, I make
I just want to be clear.
I think that everybody
that's created in
the image of God
should be treated with respect.
And I thought that
part of the American ideal
was that. But that's gone.
I promise
y'all will still be invited
to Mar-A-Lago.
If you say that it is wrong
that children with zip ties
and that American
people, American citizens,
were detained
without any warrant
or suspicion,
briefly detained
in an effort to get 37.
Give me a member. So tell me.
So what you're saying
is that no one. Are you
are you
would you be okay
being detained
so that the gang members
would you be okay
with your rights being violated
and you be held until 3 a.m.
with your family
knowing why is that okay?
Because that's not
okay with me.
Everybody here seems to believe
that if you're trend arugula,
you can go hide
in an apartment building.
And because there
are other people
there is just going
to be left alone.
That is not a reasonable
there's enforcement.
There's another option here,
and it's actually an option
that's utilized
by law enforcement
every single day
in this country.
When they are looking
for violent people,
they go
look for those violent people.
They do not subject the people
around those violent people
who have nothing to do
with them,
with arrest,
with guns in their faces,
with being searched,
with,
being a zip tied and handcuffed
and detained
every day in America,
law enforcement does their jobs
and they don't do it like this.
So why is there
every every day in America,
you're not necessarily dealing
with the most violent people
in this. We're not living.
There are violent
people who
are right here in this country,
American citizens.
They are in gangs.
They were born here.
Their parents were born here.
Their grandparents
don't believe me.
We know those people are dealt
with by law enforcement
every day.
Again,
it's a real basic question.
If you lived in an
apartment building
and there happened to be
somebody who was guilty
of a terrible crime
in that building,
and law enforcement
barged in, guns blazing,
and put every single person
in that apartment
building under arrest.
You would be fine.
But including
you and your family,
everybody is under you
and they arrested 37 people.
They arrested
this person, said.
Everybody sleep 37.
This person was
sleeping in their bed
and they were detained.
They were
put in handcuffs and detained.
And neither you nor
I was there,
you know, I were there. No.
And I know it is now 37.
You and your family,
people are now off Scott
you and your family.
You are in an apartment
building. You and your family.
You would be
fine with your liberty
being being, being held up.
Your your kids, your wife,
your children,
being detained
for any amount of time
because somebody in
that building was a criminal.
You'd be fine with that.
You are vastly oversimplifying
what's happening here. There.
I think because of
the legal immigrants.
I think sometimes
we have to simplify things
so that we, as many of them,
can what we're talking about.
Because I do think that this is
this is a problem
now for the rest
of the country.
People are going
about their lives
and they are not responsible
for the crimes of other people.
And yet in this world
in which
is operating like this,
they are being detained
for other people's crime.
I think a willingness to accept
a whole lot
of collateral
violation of rights
of of anybody,
whether you
are American citizens or not,
because there are
many rights in this country
that are in the Constitution
that don't.
It doesn't matter
if you're a citizen or not,
you're still entitled to them."

CNN’s Whitney Wild reports.  #CNN #News","New this morning.
The Trump
administration is now appealing
the ruling that blocked the president's
National Guard deployment
around Chicago blocked it for two weeks.
Another federal judge
has blocked agents from using certain
crowd control tactics
near an Ice facility
that's right outside of Chicago.
That order came down
after video surfaced.
It was this video
of a pastor
being hit in the head with pepper balls
while praying outside of the site.
CNN's Whitney Wild is joining us
now live near that Ice facility.
And what is the latest here?
What do we know about what
this appeal means, what
the judge's order means?
What are you hearing?
Well, there are several
outstanding questions here, Kate.
And the question had been,
after this ruling came down,
whether or not the National Guard
was going to maintain their presence here
while this went through appeal.
And what you see here, Kate,
and I'll just kind of orient
you toward the building here.
We do not see a single member
of the National Guard
outside Broad View,
although over the last few days
that had been visible right
now, again, we do not see a single member
of the National Guard. New this morning.
Kate,
this fence here has been up
since September 22nd.
There had been a push by city officials
to bring this down.
They were concerned that it would impede
an emergency response.
There is also concern about,
you know,
the people who live here,
the people who work here
at these impositions
that DHS has put on,
the people who have to live and work here
every day.
A judge
just minutes ago
ruling that this fence has to come down.
Both sides have until 2:00
this afternoon.
Central time to propose
how that's actually going to happen.
Back to this ruling
on the National Guard.
This is a major win,
for Illinois officials.
Here's more from Illinois
Attorney General Kwame Rolle.
I'd like to
thank the heroes.
Behind me.
Who have stood up?
Not just for the citizens
of the city of Chicago.
The citizens of the city of Broadview.
Citizens of the state of Illinois.
But I might add
that this is an important decision,
not just for the state of,
but for the entire country.
Kate,
right now
we will have to see what happens
with the appeal,
with the timeline for that.
Looks like,
I want to point out what the judge said
during this hearing yesterday,
as she was questioning,
quite aggressively,
the Department of Justice.
And what she said was that she felt like
the chemical agents that were deployed
against protesters
and members of the press
were indiscriminate.
They appeared arbitrary.
And then finally, she said,
there is just nothing to prove,
that there is actually a rebellion
inside the United States.
These were,
you know, basically
the core reasons that she decided
that the National Guard
would fall under this
temporary restraining order.
And she was issuing, again,
this partial ruling that gives a major
win to, Illinois leaders here. Kate.
And also waiting quite something
to see the attorney general
there been becoming overcome with emotion
as they were talking about this
and the legal fight ahead.
That's quite something.
It's good to see you, Whitney.
Thank you so much for being there."

Her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was detained by ICE in Illinois last week. A judge ruled Friday that Torres's detention was ""unlawful"" and in violation of his due process.

CNN's Victor Blackwell speaks with Kalman Resnick, the attorney for Ruben Torres Maldonado and his family, about the fight to free Torres and reunite him with his daughter. #CNN #News","First of all,
when you
are battling cancer,
every day matters.
Having your family around
matters.
Let me introduce
Ofelia Torres.
She's 16 years old.
She's battling cancer.
Stage four.
For the past few months,
Ofelia has had her father
to lean on.
She says her
dad, Ruben Torres
Maldonado, has been her
main caretaker.
Ofelia's family
says he's even drained
the fluid from her abdomen
at least twice a day.
That's part of her treatment.
Her dad is now not by her side
because he's in an immigration
detention center.
Here's Ofelia describing
what happened.
She made this
video for social media.
On December 5th, 2024.
I was diagnosed
with rhabdomyosarcoma.
And about a month ago,
we found out that the cancer
was going through my treatment.
And I've spent the last month
in the hospital
on October 17th,
in the evening, the
I was, discharged.
And I'm spending the weekend,
at home.
But I will be back on Monday
and my dad, Ruben Torres.
Has been the main parent
who watches my brother.
Well, I stayed at the hospital,
sometime today
on October 18th, 2025,
between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m..
He was detained by Ice
at a Home Depot
in Niles, Illinois.
Specifically
the one on Dempster.
As of right now,
we do not have any information
on what happened
while he was detained.
We only know that his car was
left in the parking lot.
And this is a video
of the state of his vehicle.
My dad,
like many other
fathers, is a hard
working person
who wakes up
early in the morning
and goes to work
without complaint,
without complaining.
Thinking about his family,
I find it
so unfair
that hardworking
immigrant families
are being targeted.
Just that we're not born here.
Thankfully,
we've been blessed to know
people who jumped
on this case immediately.
Sadly, that's not the case
for all families
and that's why
I'm making this video
to spread awareness
and remind the public
that immigrants are humans
with families and deserve
to be treated
with love and respect,
just like anyone else.
Now, the
president promised to target
and deport
the worst of the worst.
Remember that
the drug dealers,
the killers, the rapists.
Well,
what does the Department
of Homeland Security
say about Torres?
Well, here's the statement.
This is from DHS.
Torres had
This case has now gone
before a judge,
and late yesterday
a judge ruled that
the detention of Torres
was unlawful
and in violation
of his due process.
But Torres is still in custody.
Kalman Resnick is with us.
He's the family's attorney.
Attorney Reznik,
thank you for being with me.
First,
let's just start
with where I ended off.
If his detention is unlawful,
why is he still in
custody this morning?
What is
the judge
found unlawful
with mandatory detention.
ICE's interpretation
of the law
post Trump's
becoming president changed
last month.
And what
the Board of Immigration
Appeals issued a decision
that said
people like Ruben,
who have entered
without status
to the United States,
are not eligible for bond.
And what the judge found is
that is unlawful.
It's a violation
of the immigration statutes
and due process of law
and now what we're going to
have is a bond hearing
before an immigration judge
within the next seven,
six days. Now,
where the immigration judge
will decide
the conditions of release.
Will he be
what bond will
the family have to pay in order
to secure
his release from detention?
And then the proceedings will.
Continue, but
without him being detained.
And during any of
those proceedings,
Ruben is eligible to apply
for a lawful
permanent residence
based on how long
he's lived here
and the hardships
his removal
would cause his children.
And the hardship is obvious
because he's a caretaker
for a 16 year old
with stage
four metastatic
rhabdomyosarcoma,
which is an aggressive
soft tissue cancer.
What do you know, if anything,
about how Ofelia is doing now?
Because I know that
that she's put her
treatment on pause.
What do you know
about about her condition.
But she didn't
put her treatment on pause.
She went to the hospital
on Monday.
Oh, and the doctors found that
her emotional
and physical condition
after the weekend
of detention of her father
was not
good enough for her
to continue
with the chemotherapy,
so they postponed the chemo,
and we're hoping that
her dad will be back very soon.
And she will be the condition,
to continue
treatment at Lurie's
Children's Hospital in Chicago.
I appreciate the clarification
there.
I also learned from that video
and from reading
about this family.
And correct me
if I'm wrong here, that Mr.
Torres is the sole earner
for this family.
And if he is, is deported,
you know,
there's a go fund me, but
medical bills and legal
bills can run through
that quickly.
What's next for this family
if he is forced to leave
the country?
Poverty,
loss of their home
that they own
because they won't be able
to pay the mortgage.
The mother,
obviously was working, but
she had to stop working
to take care of her children.
And so the father, on the day
he was detained at a Home
Depot, was doing side jobs,
in home repair
and home renovation
to make money
to pay medical bills
of his daughter.
You heard,
my intro here
where the president promised
the worst of the worst.
And when asked about Mr.
Torres, they cited his,
traffic infractions
in the past.
What's your response,
your reaction
to the characterization
of your client
and how that reconciles
with what the,
the administration
promised would be
their targets?
We're talking here
about the best of the best.
Not the worst of the worst.
And let me tell you,
I've had
driving offenses and tickets.
Does that make me a criminal?
This is
this is a ridiculous way
in which the government
is trying
to villainize immigrants
and our country
as a country of immigrants.
I'm the son, grandson,
and great
grandson of immigrants.
We need to defend
our immigrant neighbors,
not let them be targeted
by our government.
As if they were bounty
hunters out to get them.
These people
with mass
who have no consideration of
what damage
they're doing to families,
come and resume.
Finish your answer.
No.
I hope that this case,
will help educate
the American people
about what is happening
and that they will demand
that our government stop,
start
to stop these attacks
on immigrant families.
Kalman Resnick,
attorney for, Mr.
Torres, thank you.
And we,
of course,
will follow this story
and Ophelia's,
condition very closely."
k8p6vBLT8W4,Charlotte's local shops hope for profits after ICE raids,20251129,CNN,66030,"Small businesses in Charlotte, North Carolina are hoping for a boost in sales on Small Business Saturday, especially after immigration raids in the Charlotte area which disrupted operations at some small immigrant-owned businesses.

CNN's Isabel Rosales speaks with Greg Asciutto, executive director of CharlotteEAST and CNN correspondent Ivan Rodriguez reports on the rising costs facing small business owners. Isabel Rosales also speaks with business writer Lisa Lacy about costs from tariffs and how businesses and consumers are using AI this holiday season.  #CNN #News","If you didn't get all of your
shopping done on Black Friday.
Small businesses across
the country
are counting on today,
Small Business Saturday
to boost their bottom line.
Now, one of those communities,
Charlotte, North Carolina,
is hoping for a big turnout,
especially after the Trump
administration targeted
immigration raids
which disrupted operations
at some small,
immigrant owned businesses.
Joining us now to
discuss is Greg Asciutto.
He's the executive
director of Charlotte East,
a nonprofit
focused on helping
local communities thrive.
Greg,
thank you so much
for joining us here at CNN.
Following this Border
Patrol operation,
we saw
dozens of immigrant
owned businesses
reopen, but cautiously,
some lock their doors,
some had barebones
staff members.
We saw owners
even washing the dishes,
and some didn't reopen.
What's the mood
on the ground there right now?
What are business
owners telling you?
Absolutely.
Well, good morning
and thank you for having me.
Over the past two weeks,
roughly 400 small,
independently owned
businesses are in our geography
of East Charlotte.
70%, give or take, are owned
and operated by a first
or second generation
immigrants.
We estimate that more than half
of those businesses
face some type of closure.
Many for three plus days.
With the average
daily loss of revenue
being roughly $2,500.
Last week things slowly
came back online.
You have many of the businesses
that closed for,
the full previous week.
Come back on with skeleton
crews, with owners
taking the bulk of
the labor on.
But the problem
that we're still going to have
for the foreseeable future
is large
percentage of the customer
base is still reluctant
to come out
and resume the same type
of shopping and consumer habits
as there were previously.
And what are you hearing from
these business owners?
Do they have concerns
that they might have
to shutter,
that the money's
going to be tight
if things continue this way?
So we
sure.
So we have not
heard of
any of those direct cases yet.
We are waiting
on that other shoe to drop.
You know,
we know that
the previous operation
that's happened over
the past
two weeks
is not going to be
the last time
that this happens.
So what we are trying
to do over the next quarter
very rapidly is set up
some of our businesses
to be prepared for
the next time
we have an emergency
event like this.
So get
system set up
for individual business owners
to be able to receive revenue.
Now in the form of gift cards.
Many of our businesses
don't have that system
set up
where they can take revenue
directly without making
any expenses.
We're you're talking about
for southern this thing, right,
that you're talking about that
campaign facilities that.
So yeah.
So we are also
running concurrently.
It's going to be in honor
today of launching
Small Business Saturday.
Exactly.
Matching gift cards,
for individuals
that shop at any of our 400
locally owned businesses
throughout the month
of December.
We'll be doubling
the amount of gift cards
that, patrons
receive in return.
And throughout December,
setting up a lot
of our businesses
that don't have
that operational side in place
for gift cards.
Getting them set up
to prepare for that absolute.
And if I could dig
in a little deeper
to what you were mentioning,
this survey
that your organization,
conducted of nearly 100
local businesses, those numbers
you mentioned a few of them.
The really striking.
I want to dig into this
a little bit more.
Average daily
losses of about 2500.
At least
one business
losing as much
as $12,000 in a day.
47%.
So nearly half of businesses
closed for at least three days.
How would you describe that
level of economic ramification,
and what does recovery
look like?
How long does that take?
Sure.
And I
will say that the
term that I'm using,
for our specific insulated
ecosystem on the east side,
it is extremely reminiscent
of the first week of Covid,
where a lot of business
owners shut down, didn't know
exactly how long
they're going to be
shutting down for.
Had some emergency precautions
in place and procedures,
but not quite the total gamut.
But in terms of how long
we're anticipating
this disruption,
I mean, it's easily
going to be at least a quarter,
of economic activity
until we
believe that we return
to some level of normalcy.
Well, the shooter,
thank you so much.
And I hope,
lots of folks go out there
and support
local businesses today.
And pass today.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
The holiday shopping season
is officially
in full swing,
and small business
owners are hoping
to lure customers
away from big box retailers
with a push
to shop local starting
today, Small Business Saturday.
The awareness is critical
for small businesses
that have seen surging
tariff costs and growing
payroll and health
care expenses
amid a shortage of affordable
loans.
CNN's Ivan
Rodriguez has more on
the crisis threatening
mom and pop stores
across the nation.
Small businesses are
the backbone of the U.S.
economy.
They account
for the vast majority
of total businesses
in the nation.
Nearly half of all employees
and the bulk of the job
growth in 2025.
The mood is mixed among
some of these businesses
and their employees.
Doug Scheffel has experience
as a small business owner
is similar to many others
across the country. This year.
In a small business world,
everything is cash.
It's everything.
Everything you worry about.
And,
I just see
all the costs rising.
Scheffel is the co-owner
of family run ETM
Manufacturing in Massachusetts.
Back in April,
he says he laid off about
a quarter of his employees
as the Trump administration's
tariffs rollout
dented demand for the machine
parts and sheet metal
his company sells.
It just has become
almost impossible
to plan and be thoughtful
about our workforce.
Be thoughtful about the,
how we pay those people,
how we employ them.
Beyond the economic uncertainty
small businesses
are facing enterprises,
an economist for Point
says another challenge
is accessing financing
credit conditions.
Big funding conditions
for small businesses
have tightened now
for 30 consecutive quarters.
I think that's probably going
to continue.
The average rate on a new urban
small business
term loan was over
7% at the end of last year,
according to the Kansas
City Fed.
But many small businesses
face rates well north of 10%.
All of that
adds stress on businesses
and its people.
If you're
spending all your time worrying
about how to get your payables
in line, your cash in line,
and you're taking out
really expensive debt
to cover those gaps,
it's hard to think about growth
because you just
can't afford it,
Scheffel tells me.
High prices at grocery
stores, for example,
have also left
his employees preoccupied.
They're not alone.
About 1 in 4 U.S.
households are living paycheck
to paycheck,
meaning they're spending over
95% of their income
on necessities
like housing and groceries,
according to estimates
from Bank of America.
In Atlanta, Ivan Rodriguez.
Ivan, thank you for that.
Well, shoppers
reached deep into their wallets
on Black Friday, shelling out.
Listen to this.
$8.6 billion
to online retailers.
That's up 9% from last year.
Analysts say steep
discounts helped drive
the surge as
retailers try to woo customers
during the Super
Bowl of shopping.
The surge is expected
to continue despite Americans
feeling the pinch
of rising costs.
The National Retail
Federation forecasts
that retail sales will continue
to rise
in November and December,
similar to last year.
Walmart and TJ Maxx
are expected to see
strong sales.
But others like Target
may struggle as shoppers
hunt for deals.
Long gone
are the days of lining up
outside of big box
stores on Black Friday.
Those doorbuster days
gone, gone, gone.
These days,
you can buy almost anything
online, and tech
giants are betting on AI
to keep consumers
spending this holiday
shopping season.
Joining me now is business
writer Lisa Lacy to explain
what is ahead.
And how tariffs are threatening
shoppers and business owners.
Lisa. Hello.
Hi.
Thanks for having me.
Of course.
Okay,
so what is this business of
AI can help me shop.
How does that work?
Well,
I think that there's a couple
of really good use cases
for AI this holiday season.
First and foremost
is finding deals.
So if there is
a particular product
that you're looking for,
like a Nintendo
Switch Two or a Labubu,
you can tell an
AI assistant, hey,
this is what I want.
Go find the best possible price
for me out there.
And these assistants
are really good
at just scouring
the internet in its entirety.
All of the retail
sites out there and identifying
where you can get
the best deal.
And maybe, you know,
you're looking for the item
with free,
free overnight shipping,
something like that.
They can help you find those,
those websites much faster
than you could do on your own.
They're also really good.
I don't know if you've ever
had the experience of,
like, trying to find a
promo code that works.
They're tired.
You don't want to do.
Yes.
So, they can't,
unfortunately, generate code
for you. That'll work.
But if there is
a code out there that'll work
for the product in question
that you're looking for
on the site
where you're buying it.
They they'll help you
find those much faster
than you could on your own
as well.
And also,
if there is a budget
that you're
trying to stick
to this holiday season,
you can tell the assistant
that, that you're working with,
whether that's ChatGPT.
Gemini Ford,
say, hey, this is the budget
that I'm trying to stick
to this holiday season.
This is the number of people
I'm shopping for.
Maybe even
this is what I'm thinking
of buying for them.
And then,
can you help me
kind of stick to my budget
this year?
Wow, that is incredible.
I never thought to use AI bots
and chats in this manner.
Now, today's
small business Friday.
If you're a small business,
a mom and pop shop,
how can you keep up with this?
How can you compete
with big retailers
when you don't have
the same amount of resources
to even get into AI like this?
That is a very good question.
I think it's
probably going to come down
to content, and relationships.
I think that that really
the ladder,
the relationships,
that human connection
is where the big box stores
can't compete quite as much.
And so, if you do have
relationships
with your customers,
that may be,
that may help you in terms of,
when they're doing
their planning,
using these AI assistants,
looking for the best deals.
But they may say,
you know, hey,
I want to shop local.
I want to buy it from,
you know, this store
in my community,
where I know the
the store owner.
And that me.
That's probably
the best piece of advice.
I think I could give
an intentional
use of your money
for small businesses. Yes.
Lisa Lacy,
thank you so much for this.
I guess I'll now
be using ChatGPT to help me
shop this Christmas.
So will I. Thank you so much."

#ICE #Minneapolis #News","to ICE. Get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of Minneapolis. We do&nbsp;
not want you here. Your stated reason for being&nbsp;&nbsp;
in this city is to create some kind of safety.&nbsp;
And you are doing exactly the opposite. There's&nbsp;&nbsp;
a lot of information that is swirling around&nbsp;
right now. and we collectively are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;
do everything possible to get to the bottom of&nbsp;
this to get justice and to make sure that there&nbsp;&nbsp;
is an investigation that is conducted in full.&nbsp;
But what we do know is that a 37year-old woman&nbsp;&nbsp;
is dead and that she was shot by ICE. We've&nbsp;
dreaded this moment since the early stages&nbsp;&nbsp;
of this ICE presence in Minneapolis. Not only&nbsp;
is this a concern that we've had internally,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we've been talking about it. They are not here&nbsp;
to cause safety in this city. What they are&nbsp;&nbsp;
doing is not to provide safety in America. What&nbsp;
they are doing is causing chaos and distrust.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They're ripping families apart. They're&nbsp;
sewing chaos on our streets and in this&nbsp;&nbsp;
case quite literally killing people. So they&nbsp;
are already trying to spin this as an action&nbsp;&nbsp;
of self-defense. Having seen the video of myself,&nbsp;
I want to tell everybody directly that is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;
This was an agent recklessly using power that&nbsp;
resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.
As soon as it happened and we learned of the&nbsp;
incident, we had several priorities. The first,&nbsp;&nbsp;
of course, uh was to get the victim to the&nbsp;
hospital and to get care as soon as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To the family, I'm so deeply sorry. There's&nbsp;
nothing that I can say right now that's going&nbsp;&nbsp;
to make you or your relatives or the friends&nbsp;
of the victim feel any better. Uh there were,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I believe, two Minneapolis police&nbsp;
officers that responded uh and were&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.&nbsp;
The second was to get ICE off of the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were dozens, if not hundreds of ICE and&nbsp;
federal officers that were there at the time. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;
having them there was only causing more&nbsp;
chaos. Having them there was only making&nbsp;&nbsp;
a difficult situation even more problematic&nbsp;
and one that, yes, they created themselves.
There's little I can say again that'll&nbsp;
make this situation better. But I do&nbsp;&nbsp;
have a message for our community, for our&nbsp;
city, and I have a message for ICE. To ICE,&nbsp;&nbsp;
get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of Minneapolis. We do not&nbsp;
want you here. Your stated reason for being&nbsp;&nbsp;
in this city is to create some kind of safety.&nbsp;
And you are doing exactly the opposite. People&nbsp;&nbsp;
are being hurt. Families are being ripped&nbsp;
apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents&nbsp;&nbsp;
that have contributed so greatly to our&nbsp;
city, to our culture, to our economy are&nbsp;&nbsp;
being terrorized. And now somebody is dead.&nbsp;
That's on you. And it's also on you to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's on you to make sure that further damage,&nbsp;
further loss of life and injury is not done.
We're going to be working towards justice&nbsp;
as quickly as we possibly can right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And justice is what we've all got to&nbsp;
get. Next, a message to our community.
Look, we all know that the agenda of this&nbsp;
Trump administration is to create chaos. Let&nbsp;&nbsp;
us respond right now with our best versions&nbsp;
of self. This is a moment where all of us&nbsp;&nbsp;
in Minneapolis and beyond, we can rise to&nbsp;
the occasion. We can show them who we are.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We can show them the kind of courage, bravery,&nbsp;
love, and compassion that makes Minneapolis&nbsp;&nbsp;
Minneapolis and that makes America America.&nbsp;
We are better than a bunch of ICE agents being&nbsp;&nbsp;
deployed to cities around the country and ripping&nbsp;
apart families and communities. We're better than&nbsp;&nbsp;
that. And so, we are going to meet that hate&nbsp;
with love. We are going to meet that despair&nbsp;&nbsp;
with hope. We are going to meet that injustice&nbsp;
with constitutional justice ourselves. And we're&nbsp;&nbsp;
going to make sure that in this very difficult&nbsp;
moment, we do not take the bait that these ICE&nbsp;&nbsp;
agents are trying to create and that the&nbsp;
federal government, to be clear, wants.
They want us to respond in a way that creates&nbsp;
a military occupation in our city. They want&nbsp;&nbsp;
an excuse to come in and show the kind of force&nbsp;
that will create more chaos and more despair.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let's not let them. Let's rise to this occasion.&nbsp;
Let's show them something far more beautiful than&nbsp;&nbsp;
the kind of division that they're trying to stoke.&nbsp;
Let's show them unity of purpose, of love, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;
courage of our conviction. Our conviction, to be&nbsp;
clear, is rock solid. And it is for our neighbors,&nbsp;&nbsp;
all of our neighbors. It's for people who&nbsp;
have lived here for 80 years. It is for new&nbsp;&nbsp;
immigrants who have made this city a better place.&nbsp;
That's the kind of love that we're going to show&nbsp;&nbsp;
up with right now. If you're angry, I get it. I&nbsp;
am, too. If you're feeling that kind of despair,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's understandable. Let's show them who we&nbsp;
can be. Let's show up with peace. To march,&nbsp;&nbsp;
to protest, to hug one another, to love all the&nbsp;
way with peace. Do not give them what they want.
Finally, you know, we've got a lot of work&nbsp;
that needs to happen right now to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;
that first of course the scene was secured as&nbsp;
much as possible that we were able to get the&nbsp;&nbsp;
victim now deceased to the hospital. We've got a&nbsp;
lot of work to do in the coming days. Uh I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;
thank our city enterprise for the work that they&nbsp;
have done, but more importantly what they're about&nbsp;&nbsp;
to do because this is going to be heavy and our&nbsp;
city has been through a lot. We also know uh that&nbsp;&nbsp;
we're prepared to do right for people. Among them&nbsp;
is our chief of police. Uh I'll invite him up.
My name is Brian O'Hara. B R I A N O Apostrophe&nbsp;
H A R A. I am the Minneapolis Police Chief.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This morning, Minneapolis police officers received&nbsp;
a report of federal law enforcement being involved&nbsp;&nbsp;
in a deadly force incident, meaning shots had been&nbsp;
fired. Minneapolis police officers responded to&nbsp;&nbsp;
the scene. Uh we arrived and found a woman with&nbsp;
a gunshot wound to the head. Life-saving measures&nbsp;&nbsp;
were performed at the scene, including CPR. The&nbsp;
woman was transported to Henipin County Medical&nbsp;&nbsp;
Center, where she has since been pronounced&nbsp;
deceased. The prelim preliminary information&nbsp;&nbsp;
that we have indicates that this woman was in&nbsp;
her vehicle uh and was blocking the roadway on&nbsp;&nbsp;
Portland Avenue, midway between 33rd Street and&nbsp;
34th Street in the city. At some point, a federal&nbsp;&nbsp;
law enforcement officer approached her on foot and&nbsp;
the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots&nbsp;&nbsp;
were fired. Uh the vehicle then crashed on the&nbsp;
side of the roadway. Minneapolis police officers&nbsp;&nbsp;
secured the crime scene uh and assisted in uh&nbsp;
trying to preserve the evidence that is there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have since turned over the scene both to the&nbsp;
Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which&nbsp;
will be conducting an investigation into this use&nbsp;&nbsp;
of deadly force. Um, I want to thank uh the mayor,&nbsp;
city council president, uh other members of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
city council, state legislators that were on the&nbsp;
scene. This has been um a very difficult time uh&nbsp;&nbsp;
for everyone in the city. Um and this is obviously&nbsp;
a very very tragic situation where a woman has&nbsp;&nbsp;
lost her life. That being said, in addition&nbsp;
to this tragedy uh which unfortunately we did&nbsp;&nbsp;
predict, we were seriously concerned about further&nbsp;
escalation from the scene. And I want to thank the&nbsp;&nbsp;
elected officials that came themselves uh to help&nbsp;
us prevent that from happening. uh as well as the&nbsp;&nbsp;
individuals on that scene that remained peaceful&nbsp;
and that abided by law enforcement instructions so&nbsp;&nbsp;
that we could preserve that scene and ensure&nbsp;
that a full and transparent investigation&nbsp;&nbsp;
can take place. That being said, I just echo the&nbsp;
mayor's comments that we ask uh that the community&nbsp;&nbsp;
continue to call for peace. We understand people&nbsp;
are going to be upset about what happened uh and&nbsp;&nbsp;
people are going to want to exercise their first&nbsp;
amendment rights, but please do so safely and&nbsp;&nbsp;
lawfully to ensure that we do not have any further&nbsp;
tragedy in this city or destruction. Thank you."

04:57 DHS statement confirming a woman was killed in an ICE-involved shooting 

#Minneapolis #ICE #News","Following breaking news in Minneapolis,
where city officials confirm
a shooting occurred
reportedly involving a federal Ice agent
and a civilian this morning.
You see the live pictures right there?
Our Whitney Wild is there on the ground.
Whitney,
tell us what's happening right now.
Deanna, we're in the heart
of Minneapolis.
We're here on East
35th and Portland Avenue.
Let me show you first.
I'll show you who's on scene.
That is Mayor Jacob Frye.
He's the mayor of Minneapolis.
To the side here
on the left side of your screen.
That is Police Chief Brian O'Hara.
There is an enormous law enforcement
presence here
from multiple different jurisdictions.
Our photographer is going to show you
what the crowd looks like. Your data.
Mayor Frye is now leaving.
I, I think you're probably starting
to hear people,
yelling to him, but he is now leaving.
He had
spoken with some people
on the edge of the crowd
when he first arrived.
According to a man who had video of it.
He did not come back to the crowd.
Now a crowd is following him
down the street.
But looking at right past us
is the law enforcement response here.
So you see, Minneapolis police,
you see the head of the county
sheriff's department.
We've also seen the U.S. marshals here.
We see Customs and Border Patrol.
But let me bring you up to speed
with what we know.
We, as you said,
we know that there was
a shooting involving
federal law enforcement near East
34th Street and Portland Avenue.
That was according
to the City of Minneapolis.
We do not yet know for sure
what the extent of any injuries
are or what prompted this.
Minnesota Governor
Tim Walz has weighed in saying
my public safety team
is working to gather information
on an Ice related shooting this morning.
Again, mayor Jacob Frey is here.
This is all in the context of this
ramped up
immigration enforcement
that DHS has been touting.
They say this is the largest immigration
crackdown to date.
2000 agents
spread throughout the Twin Cities.
This has been going on
for a couple of days now.
We know that
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was here
in the Minneapolis area yesterday.
And what we see now is this real quick
moment here for our own
based on our understanding,
there was a, shooting
involving federal law enforcement.
Here it is.
As, Governor Tim Walz said,
involving an Ice agent.
We are learning to know,
trying to learn as much as we can.
But let me just get you
another picture of the crowd here,
because this is a city
where these George Floyd riots
are not far in the rearview mirror.
And what I keep hearing
from people in this area
is they say, if you thought that was bad,
this city is about to.
So the
line that Minneapolis
police are telling right now
is trying to keep this calm
and not out,
because they do not want another option.
Can I talk to you of the George Floyd
riots?
And so right now,
what you're seeing
is that it is long day.
But if this is
controlled,
you're seeing a lot of flare ups
between the public and law in Chicago.
This is a very casual scene.
Although I continue
to try to find out more
about what happened.
But that's what I just story yesterday.
Whitney, you probably can't hear yourself
think because it's so loud there.
It's a little hard
for us to hear what you're saying.
Because obviously
there are a lot of people there
who who are quite angry.
Can if you can hear me.
And perhaps it's too early
to know the answer to this,
but it sounds like
officials are being quite careful
when they just say,
a shooting involving a federal agent.
Does that mean
that somebody who they were,
who they were going after,
who Ice was going after, was shot?
Was there a shoot out or.
We don't know.
We don't know yet.
I don't know if you can hear me,
but it's starting to get really crazy.
So, you know, I'm going
to give you context of all
what is going on here. Can you.
Deanna, can you hear me?
Yeah, we can.
I pull my microphone
a little closer to my mouth. Okay.
That's police Chief Brian O'Hara.
Right now,
the crowd is really directing
their frustration
that direction at the moment.
People here are really angry.
We're hearing them
yell at the Minneapolis
Police Department.
They don't feel like the Minneapolis
Police Department is serving
the Minneapolis
voters, the Minneapolis
taxpayers, right now.
And so right now, what you're hearing
is a lot of anger directed
toward the local law enforcement here,
even though they were not involved
in this shooting.
As far as we know, Dana.
All right,
Whitney, we're going to
we're going to let you go.
Obviously, it is interesting
that you're saying
that their anger is towards
local law enforcement.
I would imagine in addition
to federal law enforcement,
Ice agents in particular.
So
we're gonna let you go.
We're going to let you do some reporting.
Stay safe,
and we will get back to you
as soon as as soon as you get more.
Thanks so much for your terrific
reporting, Whitney.
DHS has confirmed that a an individual
has died.
The alleged perpetrator was hit
and is deceased.
Ice officers who who were hurt
are expected to make a full recovery.
Can you fill in the blanks, Priscilla?
Yeah. Dana looks at the scene here.
So in Minneapolis
right now, the Department of Homeland
Security has surged thousands of agents
for around 2000
agents that have been deployed
to the state of Minnesota.
And there have been ongoing operations,
especially in Minneapolis.
So that is what has been ongoing in
that city and in that area.
And this morning,
the Department of Homeland Security
says that they were conducting
what they call these targeted operations.
That is to say that
they went out to a location.
They had a target in mind
over the course of that operation.
According to their statement,
Ice officers
and one of these violent rioters
they're calling weaponized their vehicle.
This is according to their statement.
And they also go on to, say,
attempting to run over our law
enforcement officers,
and they call this
an act of domestic terrorism.
And they say
that is what prompted
an Ice officer
who they said was fearing for their life
to fire these defensive shots.
And these are what this alleged
perpetrator was hit and is deceased.
This is according to the Department
of Homeland Security.
I have asked the Department
of Homeland Security if this was a U.S.
citizen, because we do not know
the status of this individual
who was in this vehicle.
Now, of course,
we have seen in multiple cities
that the actions of Ice,
as they carry out
their operations has prompted
protesters and rioters
at some of these operations.
But generally,
I will say, Dana,
in talking to my sources
over the course of the morning,
there are a lot of questions here
about these defensive shots
the Department of Homeland
Security is talking about,
because generally,
the policy for Ice officers to use,
any to, to shoot would be if the subject
poses, quote, an imminent
threat of serious injury and or death.
So there are a lot of questions here
as to what prompted
that defensive shot
outside of the use of the vehicle.
And it is these types of questions
that would prompt
also an internal investigation
at the Department of Homeland Security,
typically to try to get the answers
as to
what exactly unfolded here,
for there to be a fatal incident
that includes Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.
And again,
it is Immigration and Customs Enforcement
that was involved here, according to DHS.
Recall that there are multiple agencies
that are on the ground
doing these immigration
enforcement operations.
And even photos of the scene showed,
at least
after the fact,
that it was both ice on the ground,
as well as local police department
and U.S.
Border Patrol,
which has similarly been deployed
to Minneapolis to continue the operation.
So we are still trying
to seek more answers here, Deanna.
But at the outset,
what we know is that
there was an ice involved shooting,
that there has been a fatality.
We're trying to get
what the status of that person
was if they were a U.S. citizen.
But of course, against the backdrop
of this massive immigration operation.
Priscilla, thank you so much for
for that reporting.
If you out
there are wondering, like I am,
what's going on
with Whitney Wild in Minneapolis,
she is fine.
She's talking to
some of the people there who are
pretty exercised."
xoXzmFRuhAQ,Protests growing after ICE agent fatally shoots Minneapolis woman,20260108,CNN,385869,"The Minneapolis community has erupted in anger and sadness after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent during a confrontation.

The shooting comes after the federal government ramped up immigration enforcement following a welfare scandal that resulted in the governor dropping out of his reelection campaign.

04:07 Law Enforcement Correspondent
06:46 Chief Brian O'Hara, Minneapolis Police
#News #minneapolis #minnesota","Growing protest tonight in Minneapolis. An ICE&nbsp;
agent shot a woman there. Witnesses say in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
face as she was in her car. She is dead. He killed&nbsp;
her. And you are looking at live pictures right&nbsp;&nbsp;
now of the streets in Minneapolis. You can see&nbsp;
all of those lights. This is a vigil near the&nbsp;&nbsp;
site where the shooting took place. Crowds have&nbsp;
been growing all night. They are chanting, ""Say&nbsp;&nbsp;
her name."" And we have just learned the victim's&nbsp;
name. She is a 37year-old woman as we said and&nbsp;&nbsp;
her name is Renee Nicole Good. Renee Nicole&nbsp;
Good. She was shot and killed today. And ICE&nbsp;&nbsp;
claims that the agent opened fire after Good quote&nbsp;
weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill him,&nbsp;&nbsp;
a federal officer. All right. Well, there's a lot&nbsp;
of video out there, so let's just show you some&nbsp;&nbsp;
of it. Here's video so you can see what actually&nbsp;
happened for yourself. We warn you, it is graphic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Renee was killed, but you see agents approaching&nbsp;
the SUV, which is stopped in the middle of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
street. They instruct her to get out of the car.&nbsp;
Now, according to Homeland Security Secretary&nbsp;&nbsp;
Christy Gnome, uh then an agent tries to pull the&nbsp;
door handle. You can see that part. The driver&nbsp;&nbsp;
then puts the car in reverse, uh which is crucial,&nbsp;
and then sort of changing direction is almost to&nbsp;&nbsp;
go around. She moves forward again, and that's&nbsp;
when the vehicle bumps the ICE agent who draws&nbsp;&nbsp;
his weapon and fires it three times. Now, Homeland&nbsp;
Security Secretary Christy Gnome calls this an&nbsp;&nbsp;
act of domestic terrorism. She says there were uh&nbsp;
three others of those today. President Trump says&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh claims online that Good violently, willfully,&nbsp;
and viciously, this is a quote from him, ran over&nbsp;&nbsp;
the ICE officer, adding that it is hard to believe&nbsp;
he is alive. All right. Now, President Trump puts&nbsp;&nbsp;
out uh his own angle of the video to make that&nbsp;
point. Let's just show you what he put out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Uh this is what he's putting out to show the&nbsp;
ICE agents life in in danger. Uh you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;
um we'll go back and show that to you that the uh&nbsp;
that he was bumped by the vehicle. We have video&nbsp;&nbsp;
from the moments after the shooting where you do&nbsp;
see the agent uh adjusting his mask as he walks&nbsp;&nbsp;
away from the vehicle. Um so that you can see that&nbsp;
there. President Trump says that he was injured is&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the hospital. Uh we have learned that he's been&nbsp;
released which is consistent with him walking away&nbsp;&nbsp;
there adjusting his mask. Now, the Minneapolis&nbsp;
mayor, Jacob Fry, had this to say about Trump&nbsp;&nbsp;
and his administration's account of what happened.&nbsp;
They are already trying to spin this as an action&nbsp;&nbsp;
of self-defense. Having seen the video of myself,&nbsp;
I want to tell everybody directly that is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fry also did not mince words when he delivered&nbsp;
a message to ICE. I have a message for ICE.&nbsp;&nbsp;
to ICE. Get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of&nbsp;
Minneapolis. We do not want you here.
Now, what happened today is something that&nbsp;
Fry spoke about and warned about last night&nbsp;&nbsp;
here on the show when he talked about the&nbsp;
2,000 federal agents who were deployed to&nbsp;&nbsp;
a city and what ICE said was going to be&nbsp;
the largest deployment ever. Here's what&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fry said. This is not about preventing&nbsp;
fraud. This is about sewing chaos on the&nbsp;&nbsp;
streets of Minneapolis and that's what they&nbsp;
are intent on doing right now. In a moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we are going to be joined by a woman who lives&nbsp;
on the street where the shooting happened. She&nbsp;&nbsp;
was recording as she was pleading with agents to&nbsp;
let a doctor check on uh Renee Good who was shot.
We have our own medics. Where are they? Where&nbsp;
are they? How can I relax? You just killed my&nbsp;&nbsp;
neighbor. You caught butter in the face. You&nbsp;
killed my neighbor. All right, we're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;
speak uh to the woman. You heard her voice there,&nbsp;
the eyewitness in just a moment. First, I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;
go to the ground and Whitney Wild, who is there&nbsp;
in Minneapolis tonight. And Whitney, the crowd is&nbsp;&nbsp;
growing where you are. What are you seeing? What&nbsp;
is the the the tone right now? The tone right now&nbsp;&nbsp;
is resilience. Uh, it is a chance to pay their&nbsp;
respects to a woman they did not know who lost&nbsp;&nbsp;
her life yards from right where I'm standing. It&nbsp;
was right on this block where, as you see in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
video, she she pulls out and the the ICE officer&nbsp;
discharges his firearm into the driver's side of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the vehicle and then she careens to the left&nbsp;
side of the street and crashes her car. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;
yards behind me is exactly where that happened.&nbsp;
Erin, when we walked up there earlier, and you&nbsp;&nbsp;
can't see it right now, but there were there was&nbsp;
a growing vigil there. Flowers laid right at the&nbsp;&nbsp;
place where she spent her last moments on Earth,&nbsp;
it was so striking, Aaron, because we it was the&nbsp;&nbsp;
first time that the public was getting a chance to&nbsp;
actually see it because this was minutes after the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Minneapolis Police Department cleared out the&nbsp;
scene had been processed and so they left. And&nbsp;&nbsp;
the scene was still so fresh that there was blood&nbsp;
on the ground. flowers were surrounding the blood&nbsp;&nbsp;
from people who had come to pay their respects to&nbsp;
her and there were fragments of uh tail of a break&nbsp;&nbsp;
light it looked like broken among the flowers. It&nbsp;
was it like I said it was incredibly striking. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;
right now what you're hearing is chanting uh we&nbsp;
are hearing over and over this crowd chant her&nbsp;&nbsp;
name. We're hearing people speak to the crowd&nbsp;
on a bullhorn. Uh this is right now a moment&nbsp;&nbsp;
of reflection and a moment of protest. Uh this&nbsp;
has turned into a candlelight vigil here. Erin,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I I think it is important to remember that&nbsp;
we are four blocks from where George Floyd&nbsp;&nbsp;
was killed. This is Portland Avenue. I'm standing&nbsp;
right on Portland Avenue and East 34th Street is&nbsp;&nbsp;
just behind me. And this is a city that's worked&nbsp;
really hard to rebuild in the aftermath of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And multiple people I spoke with today brought up&nbsp;
that this is in the aftermath of the George Floyd&nbsp;&nbsp;
riots and that Minneapolis police have tried to&nbsp;
rebuild after that. And what was striking out here&nbsp;&nbsp;
earlier, Aaron, was the crowd was so angry and&nbsp;
most of that anger was directed at the Minneapolis&nbsp;&nbsp;
Police Department who had nothing to do with this&nbsp;
shooting but quickly became the target of furer&nbsp;&nbsp;
from people who live here and work here and for&nbsp;
many people who saw it. Aaron. All right, Whitney,&nbsp;&nbsp;
thank you very much uh at that at that vigil and&nbsp;
you know as Whitney's talking about you know that&nbsp;&nbsp;
that anger initially that was directed at the&nbsp;
Minneapolis Police Department which of course was&nbsp;&nbsp;
not involved with the shooting. Uh let's go now&nbsp;
to the Minneapolis Police Chief Ryan O'Hara and&nbsp;&nbsp;
Chief I I appreciate your time uh in the context&nbsp;
of what Whitney said. Um how worried are you about&nbsp;&nbsp;
um about lashback about about this anger about&nbsp;
anything getting out of hand or violence in&nbsp;&nbsp;
Minneapolis tonight? Well, I've been uh very&nbsp;
concerned for several weeks and I've been quite&nbsp;&nbsp;
vocal about it. Um I have been worried not that&nbsp;
law enforcement, federal law enforcement activity&nbsp;&nbsp;
was happening, uh but how that enforcement was&nbsp;
taking place in the city and I have specifically&nbsp;&nbsp;
said I've been worried we would have a tragedy&nbsp;
in our community. And I would hope that everyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;
regardless of their viewpoint, can acknowledge&nbsp;
that the loss of a woman's life is tragic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Um and along with that um things in this city&nbsp;
have been very tense for several weeks and it&nbsp;&nbsp;
is a very emotional situation and it's very&nbsp;
divisive and politically charged. Um so that&nbsp;&nbsp;
is why I have been asking all of our elected&nbsp;
officials to please ask for peace and ask for&nbsp;&nbsp;
calm and as you mentioned our police officers&nbsp;
responded immediately. I responded immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the scene once I heard there was a report&nbsp;
of a shooting. Um, but unfortunately, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
as our officers were trying to leave today and&nbsp;
trying to keep the peace to preserve the crime&nbsp;&nbsp;
scene so that there can be an investigation, so&nbsp;
that there can be uh some level of uh, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
a finding related to what actually happened.&nbsp;
Our men and women became the object of hate&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh, vitrial and just the frustration uh, that&nbsp;
has been building in this community for weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, I mean, obviously it's very concerning&nbsp;
and I know in the context of that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
what Whitney's talking about, how close this is&nbsp;
to the actually what happened with George Floyd,&nbsp;&nbsp;
right? And what your city what your city went&nbsp;
through. Um, but when you talk about politicians,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you there's different video angles out there&nbsp;
now and that's what we have. It did play out&nbsp;&nbsp;
on on video. Uh, you know, the angle that&nbsp;
President Trump is sharing appears to show&nbsp;&nbsp;
the agent bumped by the vehicle and he of&nbsp;
course is characterizing it uh as he wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;
that the woman driving the car was disorderly&nbsp;
obstructing and resisting and then violently,&nbsp;&nbsp;
willfully and viciously ran over the ICE officer.&nbsp;
Um, is that is that what happened here? Is that&nbsp;&nbsp;
the version you see or is is it different? I&nbsp;
would tell you this much. We owe it to this woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;
to her family, and to the American public to&nbsp;
ensure that an investigation does occur. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and that that investigation occurs and it&nbsp;
follows all of the available evidence to&nbsp;&nbsp;
its logical conclusion. That being said, I can&nbsp;
also tell you uh law enforcement in the United&nbsp;&nbsp;
States has been training for many years to try and&nbsp;
avoid incidents like this whenever possible to try&nbsp;&nbsp;
and avoid having having law enforcement officers&nbsp;
placed into a situation with an unarmed motorist&nbsp;&nbsp;
where they may have to use force. That's why there&nbsp;
is an emphasis on proportionality, an emphasis on&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you are able to uh identify a license plate,&nbsp;
identify who the person is, follow up afterwards&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh if there is some independent crime that did&nbsp;
occur prior to the incident, right? And of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;
in this case, all that was readily available. We&nbsp;
can all see the license plate information. Um that&nbsp;&nbsp;
would have been that would have been very easy to&nbsp;
do. And then that I'm just stating the facts. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
President Trump said it's hard to believe he's&nbsp;
alive, but he's now recovering in the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;
referring to the ICE agent. Uh we we understand&nbsp;
he's been uh he's been discharged. I'm curious&nbsp;&nbsp;
u chief though how you see this because we're&nbsp;
looking at him now is after the incident walking&nbsp;&nbsp;
away he was adjusting his face mask um after&nbsp;
he was he was bumped. Obviously he appears fine&nbsp;&nbsp;
there. Do you know anything about him, who he is?&nbsp;
Um whatever happened to him? Obviously he looks&nbsp;&nbsp;
fine there. He was bumped. Um yeah, he's out of&nbsp;
whatever checkup he had. There were uh at at at&nbsp;&nbsp;
a minimum dozens and dozens uh if maybe not a few&nbsp;
hundred uh federal law enforcement officers on the&nbsp;&nbsp;
scene. I did not uh speak to anyone uh at least&nbsp;
none of them told me that they were there uh when&nbsp;&nbsp;
the shooting actually occurred. Uh but I was very&nbsp;
specific about asking u if anyone else was injured&nbsp;&nbsp;
and at the time I was told that it was it was only&nbsp;
the woman. Um, so I I don't know anything further."
B0B7KZZQ7eQ,DHS officials privately express shock over department’s response to ICE shooting,20260108,CNN,400746,"Multiple Department of Homeland Security officials privately expressed shock Wednesday over the department’s immediate response to the fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, seeing it as a break from precedent that generally points to an investigation before reaching a firm conclusion.

#Minneapolis #ReneeNicoleGood #News","Kristi Noem, the secretary
of Homeland Security.
Without any evidence at all, accuses
this 37 year
old mother of three
with just dropped off her kid at school
of being part of a domestic
terrorism
operation, and cites her
as a domestic terrorist.
Right.
And everyone we've spoken
to, Wolf, experts,
law enforcement officials, those
who use those who used to work at.
I say
it's simply too early
in the investigation,
based on what we know, based on what
we've seen,
to make any sort of claim like that
ridiculous claim.
And we have some new CNN
reporting that we're about to share
with you.
Multiple, multiple Department
of Homeland
Security officials
are privately expressing shock
over the department's
immediate response to the shooting.
CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins us now.
So you've been talking to your sources
within the agency, and it's different.
It's interesting to see how Tom Homan
has been handling this
as it compares to Kristi Noem.
Tell us more about what you're learning.
Well, in
Tom Homan, being the white House
are who took a more measured response
when he in an interview with CBS,
he said he didn't have
all of the evidence yet
for all the reasons that you to just walk
through in terms of the Homeland Security
Secretary statement and press conference,
where she called this
an act of domestic terrorism,
where she said that this woman was trying
to, quote,
run over the law enforcement agents.
There was
so much shock among Homeland
Security officials over all of that,
because typically the precedent
is that you don't get ahead
of the investigation,
that you say
there's an investigation
ongoing and, you know,
you don't draw firm conclusions.
So I was getting multiple messages
about just the sheer surprise
that the Department of Security
would reach that conclusion so quickly.
Only a few hours, actually,
after the shooting,
and reiterate that later on in the day
during that press conference.
Now, the officials
I've spoken with also cautioned
that they don't know
all of the set of circumstances here
and that they stressed
that there does need
to be an investigation.
But what they have seen in that
in the videos
doesn't seem to align with the training.
The secretary said
that the training was followed,
but typically, for example,
Ice officers wouldn't
get in front of a vehicle,
which appears to have happened here
with this officer.
In fact,
they are trained to turn
what is called, quote,
a tactical L to 90 degree angle to avoid
being in front of the vehicle
and to avoid injury.
So it's these little maneuvers
that are made
that Homeland Security officials
I've been speaking with,
say, have called into question
the conduct of this officer.
I want to reiterate, however,
we don't know a lot about this
officer yet.
The secretary said that
he is, quote, experienced.
But I will also add that
in my sourcing calls,
I have also been told
that when the hundreds of agents
arrive to Minneapolis
and Minnesota in recent days,
they did have extensive briefings
about the possibility
of protesters and agitators.
So this is something
that prior to this incident,
they had been aware of could,
could happen.
They had been told
that if it got violent,
they were to call local police
for backup.
I'm also told that in those briefings
they were told not to engage
if people were just yelling.
So certainly
there were,
agents who coming into this assignment
from all over the country,
including places like Florida,
California, Georgia,
had been advised
that there could be protesters,
but were given some level of guidance
as to how to deal with that.
Lastly,
I will say, the officer
that we don't know much about him.
He had been hospitalized and discharged.
According to my sources,
that would be typical
in an incident like this.
And he would also
typically be put on administrative leave.
I've asked the Department
of Homeland Security if that is the case
and they have not responded yet.
And just to be clear,
Ice agents aren't required
to wear body cameras, right?
And so do we have any indication
whether they.
We don't know
if they had,
the body
cameras on in this particular case
in the Minneapolis region,
they are not required
to have those body camera
on, according to a law enforcement source
that I spoke with.
So we'll see if any of them did.
But certainly
they are not required across the board.
All right, Percell, Alvarez,
thank you so much.
And joining us now to discuss
what's going on, CNN legal
analyst Elliot
William is, by the way, he's
a former assistant director
for legislative affairs
over at Ice knows the issue very well.
He's a former federal prosecutor as well.
Also joining
us, Jason
Armstrong, retired Ferguson, Missouri
police chief.
He faced a very similar situation
in his town
after the 2014 police
killing of Michael Brown.
To both of you,
thanks very much for joining us.
And Jason, let me start with you.
There are multiple angles
showing this shooting.
You've seen the video
presumably in slow motion,
regular motion several times.
What's your take
and what do you see in the video?
What I see in the video
is it looks like that
there are some vehicles that leave,
that, that area
prior to the incident happened,
and they drive past the vehicle.
The, the individual
that was shot and killed by the agent,
they drive past the vehicle
while it stopped in the roadway.
So, you know, we're hearing,
reports that
that they were blocking the roadway,
but I see vehicles leave beforehand.
Do you see the one vehicle pulled up
and the two agents
get out and approach the vehicle?
The agent that actually did
the shooting comes from the other side.
And one of the
one of the primary questions,
you know, that I would be interested in
knowing in
this is if the driver saw that individual
in front of the car
because she was engaged
with the agents that were at her window.
And when the vehicle pulls off,
these situations that unfold
very fast and quickly
and, and,
you know, it was unfortunate
that the agent
was in front of the vehicle.
One of the things
that we are really emphasizing
and more enforcement
is the tactics of de-escalation.
And one of the things that we try to do
is not put,
officers, agents in front of vehicle,
especially vehicles that are in motion
to try to avoid situations
like this from happening.
There's a lot of serious questions
raised by this video
and the different videos
we've seen of the angles, no doubt.
There's still a lot of nuance
here, though, in facts
that we just don't know.
But listen to what Kristi Noem,
Homeland Security secretary,
said not long after the shooting.
This appears as an attempt to kill
or to cause bodily harm
to agents,
an act of domestic domestic terrorism.
It's very clear
that this individual
was harassing and impeding
law enforcement operations.
Our officer followed his training,
did exactly what he's been taught
to do in that situation,
and took actions to defend himself
and defend his
fellow law enforcement officers.
Not long after, the mayor, came out
and said that narrative
from the federal officials like Kristi
Noem was B.S.
but how can you make such quick judgments
either way?
So soon after this happened?
You absolutely cannot.
Pam, have we not learned anything
in the last decade of trying to unpack
whether police involved shootings,
or even individual ones between people,
there are
a host of complicated questions
over the reasonableness
of the fear of the person
shooting in an action
that certainly can't be unpacked
from looking at a video.
I will say, setting aside
sort of the nonsense
that came from the Secretary
of Homeland Security today or yesterday.
The smartest comments,
I think, came from Tom Homan.
The borders are for the white House,
who is known as a,
you know,
somewhat of a hardliner on immigration,
somebody I worked with for years at Ice.
Tom was clear
that we can't rush to judgment
when looking at a video. Why?
Because he's
actually a law enforcement officer
and did this for decades and years
and knows
that it is incredibly risky
on either side to look at a video
and try to unpack it as if we really do.
Let me just follow up on that
and get your thoughts, because,
that the secretary of Homeland
Security immediately
described this woman.
Rene.
Nicole good, a 37 year
old mother of three
who was driving along
as a domestic terrorist.
But this was a domestic
terrorist operation against Ice.
What was your reaction?
That's very strong language,
for lack of a better way to put it, Wolf.
In order to refer to someone
as a domestic terrorist,
she's necessarily saying that the actions
were taken deliberately to intimidate
or coerce
a civilian population
or to make a statement,
to use a violent act
as a means of making
a political statement.
That's a pretty broad claim about,
you know, about an individual
that you really don't know
what statements she's made,
what writings she has made.
Has she attempted other acts before?
It's a sweeping claim,
and it's entirely plausible.
I'm not saying it's true,
but entirely plausible based on the video
that this individual may not
have had a political motive
in driving the vehicle.
And so, yes,
even if the facts might say
that she acted
with some violent intent,
there's no way you can
look at this individual right now
based on what's publicly available and,
make a claim of domestic terrorism.
She was just
she had just dropped off
her six year old kid at school
and was driving back home.
What terrorist?
Her ex-husband said that.
And then we've also found out
through our reporting.
But she was there three minutes,
before as well.
I mean, there's just a lot.
There's a lot we don't know.
But, Mike,
just to follow up on what
Jason said, you know,
he made the point that
Ice officer came up
and tried to open that door. Right.
And there is a scenario
in which she's looking
at the ice officer,
not understanding that
another Ice officer
stepped in front of the vehicle.
If an Ice officer puts themselves or,
you know,
a law enforcement agency
puts himself in a position like that
seen in front of a moving vehicle,
but then also
has reasonable fear for their life.
How do you look at that?
You, with your legal
education, Pam,
have touched
on the very nature of a factual dispute,
and there is an
actual question
as to all of these matters.
Yes, an individual,
a law enforcement officer
or any one of us might have
put themselves in harm's way.
But also been been the,
I guess, the recipient of a violent act.
And I think it's
for ultimately judges and juries
to conclude at some point,
you know,
did this person invite this trouble or,
you know, was
that was the aggressor or, pardon me,
who was the aggressor
or a perpetrator here?
And I just think from looking at a video
as we sit here,
we are not equipped to really make
definitive conclusions
about any of those facts.
Now, now again,
this all comes in the backdrop of tempers
flaring in Minneapolis.
It comes in the backdrop of a
of a political climate around
immigration that's very fraught,
both for law enforcement officers
and the public in Minneapolis.
But the idea
of simply looking at the video
and making definitive
conclusions about it at this point,
I just think it's nonsense."

#Minneapolis #ICE #news","An eye witness of the shooting
speaking out tonight.
Her name is Emily Heller.
She lives on the street
where the shooting happened,
and she filmed
video that we have here
just now to share with you out front.
It shows the chaos immediately after Rene
Nicole Good was shot
and killed by that Ice
agent in Minneapolis hours ago.
We're going to play it for you.
I do want to warn you that it is graphic.
Can I go check up Paul?
Oh, back up now.
I'm a physician.
I don't understand.
We got EMTs coming, and I get it.
Just give us a second.
We have medics on scene.
We have our own medics.
Where are they?
How can I relax?
You just killed my neighbor.
You can't fight her in the face.
You killed my neighbor.
How do you show up to work every day?
Do you do this every day?
You're killing my neighbors.
You're stealing my neighbors.
What the man.
Emily Heller is OutFront now.
Who you heard there in film
that in that horrific, traumatic moment.
So, Emily, I know you live there.
This is your street.
This is your home,
and you're inside your house.
You hear all of this?
This commotion,
everything happen is starting to happen.
Okay. Can you tell me what happened?
Then? You hear everything.
You come outside and then what?
I hadn't even gotten dressed.
I was making breakfast,
I came, I went out,
I heard the commotion.
I heard whistles,
which is a common sign of ice is nearby.
And, I went out onto my front porch.
I didn't even have shoes on.
And, within
within 60s.
Everything had already gone down.
But there was a,
there was an ice convoy
that was that seemed to be stuck.
And then,
there was a protester who was,
blocking traffic
so they couldn't progress.
And, she was
totally peaceful
and, ice,
it seemed completely unorganized.
They didn't really know
what they were doing.
They were,
screaming at her to move, move, move.
And then they approached her
vehicle aggressively.
Grab tried to open her door.
And then that's
when she got spooked, and,
she reversed her vehicle,
to turn her wheels to try to escape.
And, that's
when an Ice agent stepped in front of her
vehicle and said,
stop and then,
I mean, she was already moving, and then,
point blank,
shot her
through her windshield, in the face.
I can't imagine what it was to see that.
Emily,
the way that you are laying this out,
though, I just want to repeat
and make sure that I'm that I'm clear.
And please correct me
if I say anything wrong.
You're saying that what you saw
was disorganized ice.
But then
when they tried to get her to stop,
she got spooked.
She reversed her car
to try to turn her wheels to get away.
And that was when the officer
stepped in front.
They they were telling her to leave.
They were telling her to move.
And then all of a sudden they were
they were
it seemed like they were trying
to get her.
So they were telling her to move.
And then in a split second,
they were saying
they they were
trying to get her out of the car.
So it was like
she was trying to move
when once they were trying
to get in her in her car,
she was of course,
she wanted to leave at that point.
They're extremely aggressive.
Yeah.
She would have been scared, obviously.
You know, the President Trump,
as you know, posted
he posted a video saying that
it's lucky the Ice agent was alive.
And I just want to be clear.
The Ice agent is, is walking afterwards.
And we know that from any
anything that he had not he he's fine.
He's out.
But President Trump posted there.
Yeah, yeah.
Go ahead, go ahead.
Tell me what you're going to say
about what he did afterwards.
Oh, he he just stood there.
The Ice agents, other
Ice agents surrounded him.
He was obviously spooked, too.
I mean, they seem like children.
They seem like untrained people.
And so that agent was obviously spooked
because he had just killed someone.
And it was very obvious
to everyone who had witnessed at all,
that she would not make it.
And so they,
they kind of gathered around him
and then they got a,
there was a gold SUV that came and,
they put him in it
and got him out of there
because everyone knew
he had murdered someone.
So President
Trump says the woman was disorderly,
obstructing and resisting,
who then violently, willfully
and viciously ran over the ice.
Officer
who seems to have shot her
in self-defense.
He shared a video of the incident,
from a different angle.
What's your response
to that version of events?
I mean, that
that's the only reason why I'm here.
I don't think I'm
the most articulate person.
I don't think that I
don't want to be here.
But I knew that this would be twisted,
and it would be self-defense,
and that's absolutely not what happened.
But it's just I my
my life is forever changed
for having witnessed this, and, I,
I just can't let this narrative
that it was self-defense
go any further because it's
absolutely not what it was.
And, Yeah, my my,
my neighborhood, my neighbors,
we're all going to be
pretty traumatized for
from this from for a long time
when in that
video that you shared with us
that I just play the 34 seconds,
you know, you're
you're obviously incredibly distraught
and there's a doctor next to you
or near you.
We can, you know,
here, here I'm saying I'm a I'm a I'm
a physician, I can help.
And they say, no, we have our own medics.
But the doctors there
offering to administer
CPR, standing right there.
I don't want you have to relive
what you were looking at,
when the horror of her death.
But how did agents respond to him?
Was there a speed and a desperation
in trying
to get any sort of assistance to her.
Because it didn't
sound like that from what you gave us?
Yeah.
They wouldn't, let him near.
And they said they had their own medics
that were on their way,
which it was,
it was,
I mean, I don't know,
it was at least 15 minutes before the,
the ambulance arrived and
then the ambulance couldn't
even get through
because the Ice agents
had all abandoned
their vehicles in the road,
so the ambulance couldn't get through.
So they parked at the end of the block
at about five.
Paramedics came in
and, examined her for.
I didn't see this, but,
I just they
they were with her for a few minutes,
and then they carried her limp body away,
by her limbs.
Not even on a stretcher.
Just carried her down
to the end of the block
where they could get a stretcher.
Because there was.
They couldn't get through
with their ambulance.
Come.
Only I appreciate your
talking about this. I.
I know it has to be incredibly difficult.
And I think everyone understands
why you're choosing to do it,
to make sure people understand
exactly what it is
that you saw and documented.
And I appreciate your
being willing to do it.
Yeah.
Thanks.
All right, Joey,
you heard what Emily had to say.
And, you know, she said, I don't
I don't want to be a here,
but I'm here
because I want everyone
to know what I saw.
And and she's very clear
about what she saw.
Listen, it's got to be
a very traumatic experience.
What I'm concerned about,
though, is the nature
of the investigation.
Let's be clear
that there are going to be, of course,
local officials
investigating this Bureau
of Criminal Apprehension
in addition to the federal government,
in the event
that there's anything
federal here, of course,
then Trump
would have the power to pardon.
We're not there yet.
There's not been a prosecution.
There's not been an indictment.
There's not been a criminal,
charge levied.
However, in the event
that it goes
that way,
I think it's very important
that the community
gets a sense of fairness,
a sense of justice.
And in the event that it is federal,
of course,
there would be,
according to Trump
and what he put out already, he's judged
that there's nothing to see here.
And so if the locals get it,
what will they do?
Will they move forward?
And if they move forward,
what will that look like?
What it look like a,
you know, actual prosecute?
And what would be the prosecution here?
Criminal negligence, intent.
We'll see. Gil, I'm curious.
You Emily was talking about you.
There's that position
and I understand that in the moment.
Like this. Right.
There's the
most important thing about this
country is as a country
of rules and laws.
And if they're not upheld.
And one horrific part of something
doesn't mean that they,
should also be dropped
in another in that case.
Even with that said, though,
when the physician says I can help
and he's right there,
and maybe at that point
it appears to everybody she's dead.
But to take 15 minutes
for someone to get there
and to not allow someone
who might be able to administer CPR,
that just on a human level,
that's really hard to hear.
Well, if you do have
paramedics that are trained,
and I believe Ice and CBP,
Customs and Border Protection
has people that are trained,
and they're right there
that that can be a help.
I think you're always going to be,
as a law enforcement officer,
maybe a little suspicious of the person
that said,
wait, I'm a doctor, I'm a physician,
I can, I can help, etc..
I mean,
I think that could have been handled,
much better.
But, if they did have the paramedic there
immediately, immediately on the scene,
they're going to give,
give her treatment.
Right.
Of course, they said it was 15 minutes,
but the trauma there that you heard
the trauma.
Yeah. I mean, that's what struck me.
There's two things that struck me.
First of all,
just how horrific to witness
this on your street. Right.
And then the second thing
is her characterization
of the behavior of the Ice
agents, the lack of training, the,
defense, the disorganization,
the way that they were talking to her,
giving her contradicting,
you know, advice.
So I think there's a lot to unpack here."

#ICE #Minneapolis #News","Back now with our breaking news on the deadly&nbsp;
ICE shooting in Minneapolis. Moments ago, CNN&nbsp;&nbsp;
obtained video from an ICE officer's cell phone&nbsp;
that captures the confrontation with Renee Good&nbsp;&nbsp;
that preceded at least in part her shooting. A DHS&nbsp;
official confirms the video was recorded on the&nbsp;&nbsp;
agent cell phone camera. We do warn you there is&nbsp;
profanity. This is disturbing content. Here it is.
That's fine, dude. I'm not mad at&nbsp;
you. Show your face. I'm not mad&nbsp;&nbsp;
at you. That's okay. We don't change our&nbsp;
plates every morning. Just so you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it'll be the same plate when you come&nbsp;
talk to us later. That's fine. US citizen,&nbsp;&nbsp;
former [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You want to come at us? You want&nbsp;
to come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch,&nbsp;&nbsp;
big boy. Go ahead. Out of the car. Get&nbsp;
out of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] car. Get out of the car.
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] CNN's Josh Campbell is standing&nbsp;
by to walk us uh through this. Uh we also have&nbsp;&nbsp;
John Miller with us who we'll bring in here&nbsp;
momentarily. Josh, take us through this. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is a critical new angle. This was&nbsp;
the actual vantage point of the officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And we know that not many immigration officers&nbsp;
actually wear bodywn cameras, but in this&nbsp;&nbsp;
instance, the immigration agent was holding his&nbsp;
phone up essentially filming this encounter,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which we can now see in this video obtained by&nbsp;
our colleague Holmes Librand. So in the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you see that the officers are making contact&nbsp;
um with Renee Good there. She's parked somewhat&nbsp;&nbsp;
perpendicular in a street. Uh and there's&nbsp;
another woman that's there which is outside&nbsp;&nbsp;
the vehicle. And you can tell, you know, as the&nbsp;
exchange there with Renee Good that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
she's being somewhat pleasant. Uh the other&nbsp;
woman is, you know, kind of mouthy and, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is obviously a bit a bit tense. She, you&nbsp;
know, tells the agent at one point, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
why don't you go get some lunch, big boy? Uh you&nbsp;
also see critically, and I'll get to this in a&nbsp;&nbsp;
second, bystanders behind the vehicle. Uh we've&nbsp;
seen other angles. Uh this one shows us again&nbsp;&nbsp;
the vantage point of that officer. Another agent&nbsp;
orders Renee Good out of the vehicle. This agent&nbsp;&nbsp;
then walks around. That is the moment that she&nbsp;
then takes off. And on that audio, what we hear,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it appears that you can actually hear friction&nbsp;
on the phone. You know, it appears from other&nbsp;&nbsp;
angles that the agent was indeed struck by that&nbsp;
vehicle. But you hear on the audio, it appears&nbsp;&nbsp;
friction on the phone. That could be from the&nbsp;
vehicle strike. That could be from uh you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the the phone on his clothing, but then it appears&nbsp;
three shots were fired after that. And then you&nbsp;&nbsp;
hear uh afterwards someone it appears maybe an&nbsp;
immigration agent who was there um actually you&nbsp;&nbsp;
know used profanity you know calling calling&nbsp;
her an effing bee uh which we we heard on on&nbsp;&nbsp;
the audio there. Now let's talk about the tactics&nbsp;
for a second. So you know I can tell you this as a&nbsp;&nbsp;
former federal agent that law enforcement officers&nbsp;
can use deadly force only when necessary when they&nbsp;&nbsp;
believe that there is an imminent threat to their&nbsp;
life. In this instance you have a moving vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's coming at that agent. Now, the driver,&nbsp;
Renee Good, did turn the wheel to the right. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it appears that she wasn't, you know,&nbsp;
coming head-on at that agent, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;
trying to mow him over. But nevertheless, an agent&nbsp;
in that split-second, you know, decision would&nbsp;&nbsp;
have to make that calculation. Am I in danger? Is&nbsp;
is my life threatened here? Uh, you know, agents&nbsp;&nbsp;
are also taught, what are other options? Could you&nbsp;
move out of the way? And that's why this has been&nbsp;&nbsp;
such a contentious uh issue here. The judgment,&nbsp;
the decision of that agent to actually open fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We've heard, you know, obviously people supporting&nbsp;
that decision, others uh being quite critical. One&nbsp;&nbsp;
other thing I want to note is that when agents&nbsp;
undergo training and not just the feds, but law&nbsp;&nbsp;
enforcement across the country, it is a cardinal&nbsp;
rule that you are responsible for every round that&nbsp;&nbsp;
you fire. And one key component of that is to&nbsp;
the extent that you have the time and you can,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you must be aware of what is beyond your shot,&nbsp;
what is in the background. Here it appears from&nbsp;&nbsp;
that video that this other woman who had been&nbsp;
engaging in the agent uh with the agent was quite,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, clearly in the line of fire, but there&nbsp;
were also other people that were standing behind&nbsp;&nbsp;
that car uh on the sidewalk. And this is a res&nbsp;
residential area. And so I'm sure that will face&nbsp;&nbsp;
some scrutiny as well. The officer opening fire&nbsp;
at that moment, you know, directly, it appears&nbsp;&nbsp;
towards those other people beyond the shot. And&nbsp;
then his uh partners, and you brought this up,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Briana, just the other day, his partners are&nbsp;
there in close range as well. And so, this will&nbsp;&nbsp;
be heavily scrutinized from a tactical perspective&nbsp;
as well about the officer opening fire, but again,&nbsp;&nbsp;
just critical critical new video here that we're&nbsp;
seeing, an important angle, what the officer would&nbsp;&nbsp;
have been seeing in the moment. Yeah, the other&nbsp;
officers from the other vantage point having a&nbsp;&nbsp;
pron pronounced sort of physical reaction as the&nbsp;
shooting happens as well. It's a tense situation&nbsp;&nbsp;
between protesters and federal agents that we&nbsp;
have been watching unfold as we speak. Local&nbsp;&nbsp;
and state officials at this moment demanding the&nbsp;
federal government allow them to have a role in&nbsp;&nbsp;
the investigation. Let's head straight to Henipin&nbsp;
County, Minnesota, right outside of Minneapolis,&nbsp;&nbsp;
where our Whitney Wild is outside uh of the&nbsp;
federal building where ice stages. Uh Whitney,&nbsp;&nbsp;
just set the scene for us. Last we spoke with you,&nbsp;
we saw that there appeared to be some new concrete&nbsp;&nbsp;
stansions that were being put up, but now there&nbsp;
appear to be some more protesters arriving. Tyler,&nbsp;&nbsp;
yeah, sorry, we're just getting up&nbsp;
we're getting the peppers now. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;
forgive me. I have to pull my shirt up to talk to&nbsp;
you if you guys can still hear me. Um, so here's&nbsp;&nbsp;
what just happened. There are a few a handful of&nbsp;
people here who are, you know, you hear that song,&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ice Ice, Baby. They're playing that. They're&nbsp;
saying, ""We love ice."" And they're getting in&nbsp;&nbsp;
the mix with the crowd. And this is someone who&nbsp;
seems here intent on agitating these protesters,&nbsp;&nbsp;
saying that he he loves ICE, and he's getting in&nbsp;
the mix again with a couple of other folks here.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, here's what you're seeing. These federal law&nbsp;
enforcement moving out, pushing the crowd back.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They've let off dozens at this point of pepper&nbsp;
balls to try to move the crowd back that they've&nbsp;&nbsp;
gone uh pepper balls we've seen go as far in as&nbsp;
uh as the parking lot here across the street. Uh&nbsp;&nbsp;
this came just minutes after they put down those&nbsp;
new concrete pylons so that no one would be able&nbsp;&nbsp;
to to drive or even really walk into the driveway&nbsp;
here at the federal building or in St. Paul. Uh so&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is the type of thing we're seeing throughout&nbsp;
the day where protesters are clashing with federal&nbsp;&nbsp;
law enforcement. Uh federal law enforcement has a&nbsp;
low bar for uh anything that they think is about&nbsp;&nbsp;
to get out of control. So when they started to see&nbsp;
this clash between protesters and this lone sort&nbsp;&nbsp;
of anti-protester, uh they started they intervened&nbsp;
and began to push the crowd back. And now you're&nbsp;&nbsp;
seeing you're not seeing it right at this moment,&nbsp;
but minutes ago we saw them detonate uh pepper&nbsp;&nbsp;
balls at the crowd here. Back to you guys. And&nbsp;
so Earl, explain to us this has been a a bit of&nbsp;&nbsp;
a change over the course of the day and you've&nbsp;
been there throughout the day, Whitney. So take&nbsp;&nbsp;
us through kind of what you've seen uh because&nbsp;
there have been moments where things have been&nbsp;&nbsp;
calm and there have been moments where they have&nbsp;
been tense. Right. Right. Absolutely. So uh there&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's absolutely right. this picked up again when&nbsp;
there was that anti- uh anti-protester here again,&nbsp;&nbsp;
someone who says that he's pro- ICE. And so&nbsp;
through like you're saying, you know, throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;
the day, it sort of es and flows. This is a bigger&nbsp;
crowd than we've seen so far. Uh earlier today,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we saw a couple of people who were detained after&nbsp;
one woman slapped the side of a law enforcement&nbsp;&nbsp;
vehicle. We really see the agitation pick up&nbsp;
when they, you know, start to get close to&nbsp;&nbsp;
law enforcement or they feel like, you know, law&nbsp;
enforcement is pushing them back. And uh but it it&nbsp;&nbsp;
has been pretty calm. We we've only seen a couple&nbsp;
of flare ups until this point. This I think so far&nbsp;&nbsp;
is the most dramatic flare up we've seen between&nbsp;
the protesters here and federal law enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Briana. All right, Whitney Wild. uh keep an&nbsp;
eye on things there for us in Henipin County,"

#News #ICE #Minneapolis","And now that new video, as I said, it is so&nbsp;
crucial because it was filmed by the ICE agent&nbsp;&nbsp;
involved, but also because in in that it is that&nbsp;
it is providing an angle we have not seen before.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And it does give a whole new perspective. It also&nbsp;
though raises new questions. Kyung law is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;
go through this slowly, bit by bit, outfront with&nbsp;
this special investigation to look at every piece&nbsp;&nbsp;
of video, that one and all the others, to say&nbsp;
what is the story here. And of course, I warn you,&nbsp;&nbsp;
when you put all of these together, you will&nbsp;
have to see what happened again and again.
For the first time, we are seeing the fatal&nbsp;
Minneapolis shooting from the ICE officer's&nbsp;&nbsp;
point of view. Footage taken on his own cell&nbsp;
phone. It's a critical angle of many cameras&nbsp;&nbsp;
on the street that captured Renee Good's fatal&nbsp;
encounter with ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Using&nbsp;&nbsp;
surveillance footage, bystander video, and Ross'&nbsp;
own phone, CNN synced multiple perspectives of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the shooting and mapped this incident in 3D space.&nbsp;
Taken together, they show the fullest picture yet&nbsp;&nbsp;
of what happened that day. A home surveillance&nbsp;
camera captures a moment Renee Good pulls up in&nbsp;&nbsp;
a maroon colored Honda SUV 4 minutes before&nbsp;
the shooting. 20 seconds after she arrives,&nbsp;&nbsp;
her passenger and wife, Becca, wearing&nbsp;
a white beanie, gets out of Good's car.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Good then parks the SUV perpendicular in the road.&nbsp;
Here's how Homeland Security Secretary Christy&nbsp;&nbsp;
Noom described what Good did. ICE officers and&nbsp;
agents approached the vehicle of the individual&nbsp;&nbsp;
in question who was blocking the officers in with&nbsp;
her vehicle and she had been stalking and impeding&nbsp;&nbsp;
their work all throughout the day. Available&nbsp;
video doesn't show any possible contact good may&nbsp;&nbsp;
have had with ICE before this confrontation. What&nbsp;
this video does show is that for a few minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;
while she is perpendicular to the roadway, several&nbsp;
vehicles drive by, even large SUVs are able to&nbsp;&nbsp;
drive around her as she moves back and forth on&nbsp;
the street. And that includes this light colored&nbsp;&nbsp;
SUV. It slowly drives around Good's car from the&nbsp;
rear and stops. Agent Jonathan Ross is recording&nbsp;&nbsp;
video from his cell phone as he crosses in front&nbsp;
of Good's car, recording as he sees her up close.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She looks calm and you can see both of her&nbsp;
hands as she talks to the officer. That's fine,&nbsp;&nbsp;
dude. I'm not mad at her life. Renee Good's wife,&nbsp;
Becca, who had been the passenger in the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;
approaches. Cell phone cameras on the street start&nbsp;
recording as Ross walks around Good's car with&nbsp;&nbsp;
Good's wife following. I said, ""Go get yourself&nbsp;
some lunch, big boy. Go ahead."" Renee Good backs&nbsp;&nbsp;
her car up as the agent walks around the front of&nbsp;
the vehicle. At the same time, on the other side,&nbsp;&nbsp;
two more agents approach. One tries to open&nbsp;
the door as Good backs up. Good's vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp;
starts moving. From Ross' cell phone video,&nbsp;
you see Becca, the woman in the white beanie,&nbsp;&nbsp;
trying to get into the car again. You also see&nbsp;
Renee Good turning the steering wheel to the&nbsp;&nbsp;
right. Get out of the car. She then accelerates,&nbsp;
slowing this down again and matching the exact&nbsp;&nbsp;
time of these two angles. This angle appears to&nbsp;
show the vehicle moving close to the agent. But&nbsp;&nbsp;
in this angle, he does not appear to be in the&nbsp;
path of the vehicle when he fired. Shame. Oh&nbsp;&nbsp;
my god. What the Seconds later, Becca Good runs&nbsp;
to her wife, followed by the agent who fired his&nbsp;&nbsp;
weapon. He briefly looks into the driver's side&nbsp;
of the car and then walks away. Shame. Shame. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
what we cannot see in Ross' cell phone video is&nbsp;
if the SUV made contact with the agent because&nbsp;&nbsp;
the camera angle jerks up to the sky. But DHS&nbsp;
still says it supports the AY's initial position,&nbsp;&nbsp;
releasing the statement, saying, quote, ""The&nbsp;
footage corroborates what DHS has stated all along&nbsp;&nbsp;
that this individual was impeding law enforcement&nbsp;
and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;
or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement.&nbsp;
The officer was in fear of his own life, the lives&nbsp;&nbsp;
of his fellow officers enacted in self-defense.&nbsp;
The American people can watch this video with&nbsp;&nbsp;
their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves.&nbsp;
The shooting itself, Aaron, is also not visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You do though hear three gunshots. Aaron,&nbsp;
right, Kyouung Law, thank you very much. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
that is incredible work just to see all that put&nbsp;
together. Uh, everyone's here with me. Joey, does&nbsp;&nbsp;
that change anything? Obviously this new video&nbsp;
is a new perspective but then just as Kyouung&nbsp;&nbsp;
has reconstructed frame by frame those crucial&nbsp;
instances from all the perspectives we now have.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think it's problematic for the officers with&nbsp;
respect to justifying the force and I'll explain&nbsp;&nbsp;
why. The first thing is let's talk about the&nbsp;
policy. I do have the department of justice policy&nbsp;&nbsp;
which talks about the preservation of life but it&nbsp;
also talks about the obligation to get out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
path of the vehicle right not to stand and shoot.&nbsp;
talks about getting out of the pass of the vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp;
and it also talks about deescalation. Why is that&nbsp;
significant? I don't see much deescalation there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's important. I hear word to the effect of&nbsp;
effing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That goes to me to state of mind. So&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you're not of the officer of the office, right?&nbsp;
I mean, so it's one thing to defend yourself. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;
another thing to be angry and use animous with&nbsp;
regard to employing force. The other thing that's&nbsp;&nbsp;
troubling to me is that if you're not standing&nbsp;
in front of the vehicle, but if it seems to be,&nbsp;&nbsp;
not I'm not saying it, it's what the video shows.&nbsp;
You're off to the side of the vehicle, then how&nbsp;&nbsp;
is it representing an imminent threat to death&nbsp;
or physical injury? The other issue is you have&nbsp;&nbsp;
to justify every projectile. If you're shooting&nbsp;
a projectile and the car is not coming at you,&nbsp;&nbsp;
what's the basis? And if you're shooting into the&nbsp;
window when the vehicle's going away from you,&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's further problematic as well. So it goes&nbsp;
against the notion of immediate fear of death or&nbsp;&nbsp;
serious injury. It goes against the notion of the&nbsp;
proportionality of the force. And finally, Erin,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it goes against the issue of it being reasonable.&nbsp;
So as I see this, it's a problem to me for the&nbsp;&nbsp;
officer. Even though the White House says there's&nbsp;
nothing to see here, there is plenty to see from&nbsp;&nbsp;
my perspective. So much to see. I mean, John,&nbsp;
because also one thing you see her do, well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
there's a couple things that would show. First of&nbsp;
all, uh, her wife, Rene's wife, moves to get in&nbsp;&nbsp;
the car, which would indicate they're leaving,&nbsp;
which they were told to do, right? She moves&nbsp;&nbsp;
to get into the car at that moment. Stop filming.&nbsp;
Okay, number one. Number two, then you see her on&nbsp;&nbsp;
his on the offic, you know, turn her wheel sharply&nbsp;
away from him and then then the acceleration. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know every single instant is going to matter in&nbsp;
terms of what really happened, but uh there's no&nbsp;&nbsp;
mistaking what she's doing with the wheel. Only&nbsp;
if you're looking at it. Um, and we don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;
whether in his tunnel vision he was focused on her&nbsp;
or the front of that vehicle or its direction. But&nbsp;&nbsp;
what we do know is the value of this video is&nbsp;
it's another angle. Y uh we came to conclusions&nbsp;&nbsp;
which are now questioned when we looked at the&nbsp;
first video because we got a second video. This&nbsp;&nbsp;
would be a third video which is instructive in a&nbsp;
different way. What do we get out of this? We get&nbsp;&nbsp;
three things. One, we get that it's not a high&nbsp;
tension situation. and she's smiling and saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;
""I'm not mad."" And her friend is taunting them.&nbsp;
Um, but saying, you know, here's our license&nbsp;&nbsp;
plate. We're not wearing, right? We don't change&nbsp;
our license plate. By the way, awareness of if&nbsp;&nbsp;
you want to come and get get us later, go ahead.&nbsp;
You know, you have the license number. So, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;
tensions at that point are low. As he comes around&nbsp;
the car, the officers who pull up in the pickup&nbsp;&nbsp;
truck are saying, ""Out of the car, out of the&nbsp;
car."" They're grabbing one door handle, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;
locked. She starts to accelerate. Her her her wife&nbsp;
is on the other door handle, which is also locked.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And if you look at that video, here it is.&nbsp;
When we come around to the front of that car,&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is a different video. When we come around&nbsp;
to the front of that car, which we'll do in a&nbsp;&nbsp;
minute. Yeah. You see the if you're the agent, his&nbsp;
point of view is the car is now moving forward. He&nbsp;&nbsp;
unholers his weapon and you see the car moving&nbsp;
towards him. Then you lose sight because the&nbsp;&nbsp;
phone goes down as the gun comes up. Yeah. But you&nbsp;
hear an impact. what sounds like an impact which&nbsp;&nbsp;
leans towards the officer's account and DHS's&nbsp;
assertion that the vehicle made contact with him&nbsp;&nbsp;
and you hear a groan and simultaneous with that&nbsp;
not separate you hear these three shots. Uh at&nbsp;&nbsp;
the end of the day the three things they're going&nbsp;
to have to consider is are they in policy with the&nbsp;&nbsp;
agency? Probably not. Were the tactics good? Uh&nbsp;
it would have been easier to leave your weapon&nbsp;&nbsp;
holster and get out of the way than to end up in&nbsp;
this confrontation. But was it legal? Did he feel&nbsp;&nbsp;
threatened in the moment he pulled the trigger?&nbsp;
Oh, well, Gil, what do you see there? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
there's nothing that a city police officer would&nbsp;
do in that situation that approximates what the&nbsp;&nbsp;
ICE agent did. Meaning, in terms of the level of&nbsp;
force, they've all been trained to get out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
way of a car. Yeah. Not only the level of force,&nbsp;
but all of the other tactics. I mean, there is one&nbsp;&nbsp;
reason that the president, the vice president,&nbsp;
and the secretary are so hyperbolic over this,&nbsp;&nbsp;
because they want to get out from and away from&nbsp;
this as fast as possible. uh this is their worstc&nbsp;&nbsp;
case scenario of a white woman, a mother uh&nbsp;
being shot by ICE agents, a US citizen. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's their whole mission is to get away from&nbsp;
it. And they say, well, you know, the American&nbsp;&nbsp;
people can look at this video and make their own&nbsp;
decisions. Unfortunately for the administration,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the American people have already looked at this&nbsp;
video and they have made a determination about&nbsp;&nbsp;
this. This is their Kent State moment. So Joey,&nbsp;
I mean to what Gil is saying when when you look&nbsp;&nbsp;
at it and I understand what you're saying John&nbsp;
the kind of second by second millisecond actually&nbsp;&nbsp;
milliseconds are going to matter. Um and in the&nbsp;
millisecond you know did he feel scared suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;
something goes from this level to to this level.&nbsp;
Okay but I guess what you see when you look at&nbsp;&nbsp;
this and I don't know how you can't see it Joey&nbsp;
is that it didn't have to end this way right? He&nbsp;&nbsp;
could have stepped away as angry as he may have&nbsp;
been in that moment and she would have driven&nbsp;&nbsp;
off because she had turned the wheel. They could&nbsp;
have arrested her. They could do whatever they&nbsp;&nbsp;
wanted to do later. They had the as as her wife&nbsp;
said, you got our license number. Yes. So, look,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you never want to be give condemnation to police&nbsp;
or law enforcement. At the same time, you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;
act reasonably. And I think people have a right to&nbsp;
believe that if they're ICE agents or anyone else,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the first objective is is this notes is the&nbsp;
preservation of life. And when you see a&nbsp;&nbsp;
situation where you have an officer firing where&nbsp;
they're off to the side of the car, it refutes and&nbsp;&nbsp;
disputes a narrative that the car is coming at me.&nbsp;
Now, let's just say that that was the case. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;
you parse this. Was the first shot, right? Was&nbsp;
that then potentially okay or justified right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;
That'll be an open question. But what about the&nbsp;
other shot shot when you're clearly on the side&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the car into the driver's side? How is that&nbsp;
justified? Where is the immediate of the threat"

you see sort of the law enforcement officers&nbsp;&nbsp;
strategizing. They do seem to be going back&nbsp;
at this point. Not sure the exact strategy,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but you see them now retreating back. a big law&nbsp;
enforcement presence. But again, as they swelled&nbsp;&nbsp;
quickly, they seem to be shrinking back. But a&nbsp;
show of force, no doubt, that these protesters&nbsp;&nbsp;
do not seem to be intimidated uh by for whatever&nbsp;
reason. They are still yelling. They've gotten&nbsp;&nbsp;
even louder. And so this just represents, I think,&nbsp;
a little bit of the anger that that we've seen&nbsp;&nbsp;
in various parts uh of the Minneapolis area over&nbsp;
the last few days since the day of the shooting.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And of course, we're not hearing the dialogue&nbsp;
from the federal law enforcement uh there or any&nbsp;&nbsp;
representation from, but just as you described,&nbsp;
seeing them shrinking back, I wonder if that is&nbsp;&nbsp;
simply representative of an attempt to deescalate&nbsp;
what is a very heightened, tenuous moment here.&nbsp;&nbsp;
going on. It really is. Uh, you know, I I I think&nbsp;
it's hard to know their their exact strategy,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but depending on jurisdictions. For example, I'll&nbsp;
compare what we just saw there with what we saw&nbsp;&nbsp;
last night with local law enforcement out in the&nbsp;
streets of downtown Minneapolis where there was&nbsp;&nbsp;
not a police presence at all, it seemed like, for&nbsp;
portions of the protest. And then all of a sudden,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we couldn't really look anywhere without seeing&nbsp;
law enforcement at the state local uh at the state&nbsp;&nbsp;
and local level as well. So, it was a little bit&nbsp;
of a similar strategy here. And now you sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;
see what has become the uh I guess the standard&nbsp;
protection here at this point. Federal protective&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh service police sort of guarding this entrance.&nbsp;
But prior to this, when these vehicles were coming&nbsp;&nbsp;
in and out of this federal facility, there was not&nbsp;
any visible security presence, at least to what&nbsp;&nbsp;
we're seeing uh right now. Now, it does seem that&nbsp;
tempers have calmed a little bit, but as soon as&nbsp;&nbsp;
they left, you see people are now getting right&nbsp;
back into the street as well and some of that&nbsp;&nbsp;
similar posturing that we saw before federal law&nbsp;
enforcement sort of had that show of force. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is something again it it we've seen flare-ups&nbsp;
here come in and out over the course of the day at&nbsp;&nbsp;
various portions of entrances to this federal&nbsp;
building. There was one that even a few days&nbsp;&nbsp;
ago forces have to run because of uh an agents uh&nbsp;
agents sprinting into the crowd to sort of arrest&nbsp;&nbsp;
people. We haven't seen that here, but that's&nbsp;
sort of the range of what we've seen. Uh crowd&nbsp;&nbsp;
repellent used at points, pepper balls, uh and&nbsp;
what protesters have done is at at the most we've&nbsp;&nbsp;
seen is is throw snowballs as well. So that's&nbsp;
that's kind of what we've been seeing here as&nbsp;&nbsp;
cars sometimes honk in support. Yeah, interesting&nbsp;
moment yet still very tense moment. Omar Jimenez,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we'll check back with you uh there outside that&nbsp;
federal building in the Minneapolis area. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp;
you. Hundreds of protests are underway or&nbsp;
planned nationwide today in response to the&nbsp;&nbsp;
deadly Minneapolis shooting of Renee Good by an&nbsp;
ICE agent. Protests are already happening at a&nbsp;&nbsp;
federal building near Minneapolis where some&nbsp;
ICE detainees have been held. And overnight,&nbsp;&nbsp;
hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside&nbsp;
a hotel they believe was housing federal&nbsp;&nbsp;
agents. Police declared an unlawful assembly and&nbsp;
arrested more than two dozen people. And today,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the mayor of Minneapolis urged demonstrators&nbsp;
to keep the protest peaceful and warned that&nbsp;&nbsp;
those who don't will be held accountable. The vast&nbsp;
majority of people have protested peacefully. to&nbsp;&nbsp;
the few that have caused damage to property and or&nbsp;
harm to others. Need to be very clear, we're not&nbsp;&nbsp;
going to let that happen. If you cause damage to&nbsp;
property or put others in dangers, uh you're going&nbsp;&nbsp;
to be arrested. We are a safe city. We will not&nbsp;
counter Donald Trump's chaos with our own brand&nbsp;&nbsp;
of chaos here. CNN's Omar Jimenez is joining&nbsp;
us now from outside that federal building near&nbsp;&nbsp;
Minneapolis. Omar, tell us what's happening there.&nbsp;
Yeah, so we're here at what is really a small&nbsp;&nbsp;
protest at the moment, but this has really been&nbsp;
where a lot of the protests have happened over&nbsp;&nbsp;
the course of the past few days since Renee Good&nbsp;
was shot and killed. What you're seeing right now&nbsp;&nbsp;
is it seems like a a group of people walked up to&nbsp;
sort of the entrance to this federal facility and&nbsp;&nbsp;
they're speaking to some federal agents. And kind&nbsp;
of what's happening is every time agents pull out&nbsp;&nbsp;
as you're seeing here, protesters get especially&nbsp;
angry, yell at the vehicles as they're leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;
this particular area. You see how close they're&nbsp;
getting actually as these vehicles are pulling&nbsp;&nbsp;
out. And that has sort of been what we have seen&nbsp;
at least today and pretty similar to what we've&nbsp;&nbsp;
seen over the past few days. Now, I will say&nbsp;
that just by sheer numbers, what we're seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;
at the moment is a little bit lighter than what&nbsp;
we had previously seen. But earlier today, we had&nbsp;&nbsp;
three members of Congress, including Congresswoman&nbsp;
Ilhan Omar, who represents the Minneapolis area,&nbsp;&nbsp;
try to come and do an oversight visit here to this&nbsp;
federal facility. and they said they were let in,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but only briefly because not long after they&nbsp;
received notification that they had to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but they said that they observed uh 20&nbsp;
detainees there as they described it. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh that just adds to a little bit of of the&nbsp;
back and forth that we've seen here. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you have members of Congress coming in here&nbsp;
trying to do some of that oversight. They say&nbsp;&nbsp;
they weren't allowed to do so in the way that&nbsp;
they deemed appropriate. Fred, and and then&nbsp;&nbsp;
what about last night? What are officials saying&nbsp;
about the protests that have continued? Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I mean, we've been seeing protests pop up in&nbsp;
places all across the Minneapolis area. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you have this one uh outside this federal building&nbsp;
as you see them still shouting as vehicles come in&nbsp;&nbsp;
and out. But last night, we were in downtown&nbsp;
Minneapolis and that's where we saw firsthand&nbsp;&nbsp;
hundreds of protesters in the streets marching,&nbsp;
centering on hotels where they believed federal&nbsp;&nbsp;
agents may have been staying at points. And&nbsp;
there was a point when we were out there, we&nbsp;&nbsp;
didn't see any law enforcement as they were sort&nbsp;
of banging on drums, singing, blowing whistles,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and then they showed up almost all at once. And&nbsp;
so the police chief in Minneapolis was asked about&nbsp;&nbsp;
that dynamic today. Take a listen to what he said.&nbsp;
This what you saw last night was a disciplined&nbsp;&nbsp;
and restrained response. Uh I think it was highly&nbsp;
professional. Uh, and I'm thankful for the members&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the community who understand our need to uh,&nbsp;
keep things peaceful. And I'm thankful for those&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh, officials and others that are continuing&nbsp;
to call for peaceful protest and assembly.
And to that point, while there was damage done to&nbsp;
to some of the some property, as we understand,&nbsp;&nbsp;
from police, it really wasn't until law&nbsp;
enforcement then showed up what seemed like all&nbsp;&nbsp;
at once, not only Minneapolis police, but state&nbsp;
police, even uh Department of Natural Resources,&nbsp;&nbsp;
as was described as well, and they made 29&nbsp;
arrests, but not before making multiple warnings&nbsp;&nbsp;
that we heard over the loudspeaker ourselves,&nbsp;
declaring those an unlawful assembly. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;
the mayor is encouraging more peaceful protests,&nbsp;
but as we understand over the course of today,&nbsp;&nbsp;
there will be a number of protests in the&nbsp;
Minneapolis area, channeling that same anger&nbsp;&nbsp;
we've seen since the day of the shooting and&nbsp;
even before that, wanting federal immigration&nbsp;&nbsp;
enforcement agents out of Minneapolis. Fred, yes,&nbsp;
and in that area as well as across the country, um&nbsp;&nbsp;
there are people who are gathering for what many&nbsp;
are calling a weekend of action. and Omar Jimenez.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We'll check back with you there in the Minneapolis&nbsp;
area. All right, more than a thousand protests&nbsp;&nbsp;
are expected this weekend nationwide as folks&nbsp;
are rallying against ICE in their communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A coalition of advocacy groups coorded the&nbsp;
coordinated the ICE out for good events in&nbsp;&nbsp;
response to both the fatal shooting of Renee Good&nbsp;
and the quote pattern of unchecked violence in&nbsp;&nbsp;
marginalized communities end quote. CNN's Camila&nbsp;
Duchales is joining me right now uh from outside&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh the White House. Very rainy Washington DC&nbsp;
there, but it doesn't appear to be much of a&nbsp;&nbsp;
deterrent for a lot of people who have gathered.&nbsp;
What's happening? That's That's right. We're&nbsp;&nbsp;
outside in DC. We're walking with protesters. I&nbsp;
spent just a few hours just talking to some of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the protesters that came out to here today. And a&nbsp;
lot of them said that despite the weather, it was&nbsp;&nbsp;
very important for them to come out, show their&nbsp;
support of this protest, and most importantly send&nbsp;&nbsp;
a message that what just transpired in Minneapolis&nbsp;
with an ICE agent shooting and killing Renee Good&nbsp;&nbsp;
is unacceptable. Now, I talked to some protesters,&nbsp;
one of which was actually even from Minnesota,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and he said simply that he was shocked when he&nbsp;
heard the news. Now, I asked other protesters&nbsp;&nbsp;
that came out in attendance today what their&nbsp;
thoughts is and what do they want lawmakers to&nbsp;&nbsp;
do in light of what just happened. And they said&nbsp;
something pretty notable. They said that what they&nbsp;&nbsp;
witnessed in these past few months since Trump,&nbsp;
President Trump has came into office. They say&nbsp;&nbsp;
that they really do think that lawmakers need to&nbsp;
do more and implement more reforms when it comes&nbsp;&nbsp;
to federal agencies that handle law enforcement.&nbsp;
And they think that this really what just it&nbsp;&nbsp;
happened has really shown a light that it's more&nbsp;
important now than ever for members of Congress,&nbsp;&nbsp;
not just Democrats, but Republicans as well to&nbsp;
band together now and implement more reforms&nbsp;&nbsp;
when it comes to federal agencies that play a&nbsp;
big role in what's happening in the country.
The Republicans are just spineless,&nbsp;
spineless. They're cowtowing to Trump&nbsp;&nbsp;
and I don't understand why. um he's out of&nbsp;
control and we need to put these agencies&nbsp;&nbsp;
I mean Christine Gnome needs to be chucked&nbsp;
and everybody needs to be there needs to be&nbsp;&nbsp;
some control and some rules and the rule&nbsp;
of law they need to listen to the courts
now as you can see there's more people are&nbsp;
joining this protest now and a lot of them&nbsp;&nbsp;
are holding up signs saying August must&nbsp;
go saying that they that President Trump&nbsp;&nbsp;
himself must go. And a lot of them feel that&nbsp;
attending this protest today is really sending&nbsp;&nbsp;
a clear message not just in Washington but&nbsp;
across the country where these protests are&nbsp;&nbsp;
happening that what has happened is unacceptable&nbsp;
and that they will now no longer really stand by&nbsp;&nbsp;
and just witness what is happening that they&nbsp;
really want to feel that they are attending&nbsp;&nbsp;
a movement joining a movement to really&nbsp;
spark change. All right, a boisterous and&nbsp;&nbsp;
voluminous crowd right there in Washington DC&nbsp;
as it continues to rain. Uh but certainly not&nbsp;&nbsp;
stopping the protest and their feelings right&nbsp;
there. Camille Desales, thank you so much."
T-UL_rEH1WQ,Tapper presses Noem on ‘domestic terrorism’ labeling after ICE shooting,20260111,CNN,822975,"CNN's Jake Tapper speaks with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to break down the timeline of events before and after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, as well as the Trump administration's response. 

 Watch the full interview here: https://cnn.it/3Ndhn1I

00:00 Jake Tapper asks Kristi Noem about her initial statement on the ICE shooting 
02:10 Kristi Noem pressed on labeling the victim of the ICE shooting as a domestic terrorist 
04:08 Noem discusses how she reached her conclusions ahead of an investigation 
06:55 When can DHS officers use deadly force 
09:01 Tapper asks Noem what evidence she’s using to support her conclusion  

#ICE #Minneapolis #News","You've also been criticized
for your comments.
The shooting, we should note,
was Wednesday a 10:37 a.m. eastern.
Just over two hours later,
the Department of Homeland Security
put out a statement definitive Lee
asserting what had happened.
Defending the Ice agent accusing
Renee Goode of domestic terrorism.
That's a characterization
that you reiterated in a press conference
half an hour later,
and Republican Senator
Tom Tillis said, quote,
it was very unusual
to have a senior law enforcement
official to draw a conclusion
about an event
where the scene was still
being processed.
Generally speaking, law enforcement
would recognize that a life was lost,
that families are changed forever.
The shooter's life will change forever.
We're collecting video.
We're trying to assess the situation.
Why did you not wait for an investigation
before making your comments?
Oh, well,
everything that I've said
has been proven to be factual
and the truth.
This administration
wants to operate in transparency.
I have the responsibility
as the secretary of Homeland Security,
to know this information
as soon as possible.
Had just been in Minneapolis
the day before.
Had already had conversations
with officers
on the ground and supervisors
and knew the facts
and decided that the department
and the people of this country
deserve to know the truth,
that the situation
of what had unfolded in Minneapolis.
With all due respect, Secretary,
the first thing you said was, quote,
what happened was our Ice
officers were out
in an enforcement action.
They got stuck in the snow
because of the adverse weather
that is in Minneapolis.
They were attempting
to push out their vehicle,
and a woman attacked them
and those surrounding them
and attempted to run them over
and rammed them with her vehicle.
That's not what happened.
We all saw what happened.
It absolutely is. What happened?
Those officers had been out
in enforcement action.
A vehicle had been stuck.
They had come to help
get that vehicle out.
That's when this individual
started blocking traffic for minutes.
And then he said that
the woman attacked them
and surrounded them
and attempted
to run them over and rammed the vehicle,
blocked the road for a long time,
and was yelling at them
and impeding a federal
law enforcement investigation.
That's what
you need to focus on, Jake,
as they were breaking the law by impeding
and obstructing
a law enforcement operation,
they were breaking the law already,
and these officers were doing their due
diligence with their training,
had compared them to do
to make sure they were handling
it appropriately.
You said within hours of her
being killed,
you said that
she was a domestic terrorist.
How do you define domestic terrorists?
She weaponized her vehicle
to conduct an act of violence
against a law enforcement officer
and the public. How crazy is that?
How can you assert with certainty
that she was trying
to hurt the officer, as opposed to
she was trying to flee the scene?
If you look at what
the definition of domestic
terrorism is,
it completely fits
the situation on the ground.
This individual,
as you saw
in the video
that we released just 48 hours
after this incident,
showed that this officer
was hit by her vehicle, she weaponized it
and he defended his life
and those colleagues around him
in the public eye.
The question is, I don't doubt
my position is I wasn't there.
I didn't see it.
Some people say that
it clearly showed that
she was trying to hit him
and did some people saying no.
She was clearly trying
to move her car and flee and get away.
I don't know.
What I'm saying is, how do you know?
How can you assert for a fact
within hours
before any investigation,
this is what happened.
The facts of the situation are
that the vehicle was weaponized
and it attacked
the law enforcement officer.
He defended himself
and he defended those
individuals around him.
That is the definition
when there is something
that is weaponized
to use against the public
and law enforcement,
that is an act of domestic
terrorism happened in our in our shores.
It happened here in our country.
You don't get to change the facts
just because you don't like them.
We will continue
to look at this individual
and what her motivations were.
We know that there was
throughout that morning
she had harassed
and impeded law enforcement operations.
That raises the suspicion level
with all of these law
enforcement officers.
As far as paying attention
to what her capacity is.
And as you see on the videos,
and they've proven out
that this law enforcement
officer took the action
that his training prepared him for,
and he worked to make sure
that he could save his own life
and those around him.
How can you assert
that there's no ambiguity in this
before any investigation has taken place?
I had just been in Minneapolis
and had been with
those officers, had seen
what they were facing on the streets
every day,
and had talked to their supervisors
as soon as the incident happened
and had gotten to facts and seen videos
before I ever went to talk
at that press conference.
And the Trump
administration and President Trump
is the most transparent
and open government that we've ever had.
Give them give the public
the information.
Give them
what they need to know about a situation.
They can have the truth
as soon as possible.
So if this agents were perfectly fine,
if everything he did was accurate,
does that mean that other Ice agents
should be fine?
He was injured. He went to the hospital.
No, his actions were fine.
I didn't say
I think a lot of people and guests
and even you
yourself, called the situation
something very different
and untruthful about what it was.
As far as
what did I say that was untruthful
that this was not a correct definition
of what was happening
on the ground, that I said that your
your description,
they were attempting
to push out their vehicle
and a woman attacked them
and those surrounding them
and attempted to run them over
and ram them with their vehicle
is not what we see on the videotape.
And it's not.
It absolutely is.
The facts of what happened on the ground
that day,
they were there
pushing out a vehicle earlier.
They had got help.
But that's not what you said.
That's not what you said.
Yes, they were pushing.
That's what I said. There's not one.
We have seen the video.
We don't I don't need to relitigate it.
We've all seen the video.
She is blocking the street.
They approach her.
You haven't seen the video
of the entire morning
and the previous encounters
with this individual.
We we have aired it.
Yes we have.
On Thursday
we were airing and noting the fact
that she was there for several minutes,
for minutes and minutes and minutes,
she was protesting without
and at previous locations that morning
that absolutely
that these vehicles
had been previously down
the block on video that you haven't seen.
There's more information.
But the question
the question is not being law
enforcement operations
throughout the previous moments
and hours before
this, when the question is
what was she doing
when she was moving her car?
It's a question.
That's the question
is, is
why are we arguing with the president
who's working to keep people safe?
Why are we arguing with law enforcement
operations that have gone on
in this country for years,
and we're working to collect
murderers and rapists
and drug traffickers and fraudsters
off the streets of Minnesota.
And we don't have local law enforcement
and local
elected officials that are partnering
with us to help do that work.
Overwhelmingly,
the people in this country said
they wanted America
to be safe again,
that they didn't want dangerous
criminals on our streets.
I would encourage
the elected leaders in that city
and in that state to work with us
so that we can do our operations
without the kind of opposition and
and people that are conducting
and perpetuating
the kind of violent rhetoric
that we're seeing today.
DHS policy authorizes
use of deadly force only, quote,
when no reasonably effective,
safe, and feasible alternatives
appears to exist.
Could he not have just
gotten out of the way
that this individual
and this officer is a highly experienced
law enforcement officer?
He has years of training and specialized
training for these types of situations.
We're grateful that he's alive,
and it's a tragic situation.
And we're going to continue to
to work on the investigation
into the individual
and find out what the motivations
were behind their actions that day.
We're grateful that,
that he's alive, too.
I want to play this moment
from the officer's cell phone video,
the alt right.
Welcome.
Good.
Is that Agent Ross's voice calling
Ronan good a fucking bitch?
I can't determine which one it is that
it could be, sir.
In June of last year,
Agent Ross
had his arm pinned in the back
window of a car
as an undocumented immigrant
who was a criminal drove
away from a traffic stop,
it dragged him about 100 yards.
Here's
what Vice
President Vance said about the incident
this week.
That very off ice officer
nearly had his life ended,
dragged by a car
six months ago, 33 stitches in his leg.
So you think maybe he's a little
bit sensitive
about somebody
ramming him with an automobile?
If this is relevant?
First of all, it's horrible
that that happened.
If it's relevant,
which the vice president
seems to think it is,
do you think this understandably
very traumatic event
this officer went through last June
might have influenced,
as the vice
president is suggesting, happened,
how he responded?
Now, there's no indication to that.
But the facts are,
is that we've seen vehicles
weaponized over 100 times
in the last several months
against our law enforcement officers.
So they definitely know
that the threat is real, that individuals
who are trained by activists to go out
and to impede their law
enforcement operations
will weaponize their vehicles
and try to run them over
and drag them and not stop.
So they certainly go
into these situations
with that knowledge
that that could happen.
And that's what
their training prepares them for.
What evidence are you looking at that
so many other people
around the country look at
and they say, it looked to me.
Her tires were turned to the right.
She was moving her car
and they see a woman trying to flee.
You say she was trying to
kill the officer.
No investigation has happened.
What? What do you.
Why are you so certain
that your interpretation is the truth
when an investigation
hasn't even happened?
Jake, I'm watching the.
I'm watching the videos.
Other people
getting come back
with everything
that we've stated as a Department
of Homeland Security
and this administration has been factual.
And I wish we would talk factually
about what we see every day
from these protesters,
what they do,
what they say, how
they chant over and over,
kill ice, attack law enforcement,
how they're trained
to perpetuate violence against them
and to stop the work
that they do every day.
Each of these law enforcement officers
takes an oath to protect this country
and uphold the law.
They go out every day
and enforce the laws of this country
to keep people safe.
So these individuals that are out there
harassing them,
why they do that work,
doxing their identities, threatening them
and their families, it's unacceptable.
And that's why President
Trump is so strong
in supporting their operations
in all of these cities.
The officer
appeared to have fired three shots,
the first one through the front
windshield,
the second and third
through the side window.
What is the justification for
the second and third,
given that the officer was out of home
watching the same videos?
That I am correct.
Yeah, yeah, you're watching the same one.
So you see how quickly
the situation unfolded,
how the officer was
in front of the vehicle
when she sped off, how she ran into him,
and how he had to take quick action
based on his training to defend himself
and his colleagues around
once he's out there.
That's very clear and factual.
From the videos that you can see, it's
nobody's interpretation.
We don't get to change it
because we can see it with our eyes,
and we can build on the evidence
that we have on the ground."
aaGCZsymYz8,MN mayor: ICE and Noem are making city ‘far less safe’,20260112,CNN,257672,"Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, doubled down on his claims that ICE operations are making the city less safe after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged him to tone down the rhetoric following the killing of Renee Nicole Good.

00:00 Minneapolis mayor responds to criticism from Kristi Noem 
02:16 Minneapolis police chief talks about use of force tactics 
05:05 Mayor speaks about whether his rhetoric could agitate protesters  

#Minneapolis #KristiNoem #News","Joining us now to
respond, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey
and Minneapolis Police
Chief Brian O'Hare.
Mayor Frye, your response
to what you just heard
from Secretary Noem?
She invoked you by name.
That was some wild and crazy stuff.
You know,
it sounds like she doesn't believe
a single word
that she is saying right now.
And I don't know if Donald Trump
was drinking a glass of water
if she would actually be able to speak.
Because here's the thing.
She's calling Minneapolis,
like this dystopian hellhole.
You know how many shootings
we've had so far this year? Two.
And one of them was ice.
Two shootings in a large city
so far this entire year.
And one of them is ice.
This is a safe city. Ice.
And Kristi
Noem and everything they're doing
is making it far less safe.
I want you to
respond to what she said about
you telling Ice to get the f out.
She says you and the leaders
in Minneapolis
have been demonizing Ice officers.
And it is true that you've been critical
of Secretary, known
for her quick characterization
of the incident.
But but you also
said on Wednesday, quote,
this was a federal agent
recklessly using power
that resulted in somebody dying.
Does your rhetoric need to change?
Yeah, yeah.
I said
this was a federal agent recklessly
using power
that ended up in somebody dying
because that was a federal
agent recklessly
using power that ended up in somebody
dying is exactly what happened.
I mean, am I biased in this?
Of course.
And I'm biased because I got two eyes.
Anybody can see these videos.
Anybody can see that
this victim is not a domestic terrorist.
I mean, my goodness,
she's like doing a three
or a 4 or 5 point turn.
This looks like somebody
that's trying to get out of there.
If doing a three point
turn or a four point
turn is a domestic terrorist, and my,
my wife is a criminal every single day.
This does not make sense.
We've got
to be operating from a point of,
of course, have this investigation.
It should be a neutral,
unbiased investigation
where you get the facts, you know.
And by the way, I shouldn't
be the one conducting the investigation,
nor should Christie known.
But you should have an entity
that is able to do it
with some common sense
and operating in reality.
Chief, what's your reaction
to the Homeland Security
Secretary's claims?
And also just the assertion
that the officer feared for his life.
Well, I got to tell you,
as a matter of policy
and training
amongst professional police departments
for many, many years in this country,
we have an obligation to ensure,
particularly during traffic stops,
that our officers are doing
everything possible
so that we don't unnecessarily
put their lives in jeopardy
so that our officers
are not unnecessarily creating a risk
of imminent threat to of, death
or serious bodily injury.
Other to themselves or others.
And that means that
they have to employ
sound tactics
and must be proportional in what they do.
That being said, it's not always 100%.
Law enforcement
officers cannot control
the actions of other people.
And that's why,
a full and thorough investigation,
in every case where there is
a use of force is necessary.
I will be the first one
to stand up for my cops
when a situation happens.
And it is abundantly clear,
that there's no indication to, to think
that an officer could have possibly done
anything else.
I'll be the first one to stand up and say
my cop put their lives on the line,
and they did what they have to do.
And I have no reason to think
that it wasn't
anything other
than our policy and lawful.
But I think, you know,
we have to use caution,
even as, Tom Homan has said,
and allow a full,
an impartial investigation to proceed.
Mayor fry,
the police union in Minnesota,
released a statement that says, in part,
quote, the hateful
and anti law enforcement rhetoric
by Mayor Fry and other politicians
have made their jobs
and those of local and state
law enforcement
more difficult and dangerous.
The job of law enforcement
is difficult and dangerous enough
without the agitation
by leaders in our state
and communities, unquote.
Do you think that you could,
bring down your rhetoric?
Do you think you should?
Well, hang on a second.
I support our law enforcement.
Our police officers in Minneapolis
are doing an incredible job.
I am so proud to work with them.
I was the guy, by the way,
that stood up against
defunding the police back
when it was hard five years ago.
And these honorable officers
that have stayed
and that have come on
have been incredible.
By the way, community members
that have traditionally
been pretty critical of law enforcement
officers are supporting our police.
They have kept people safe.
They have done right.
They have abided by the Constitution,
which is a massive juxtaposition
against what we've seen
from some of these Ice agents.
And yeah, no, they have my support.
So, I mean,
as far as my position
vis-a-vis law enforcement
know, we're there with them,
but that's the that's not me.
It's the Minnesota Police union
saying that your rhetoric
agitates these protesters.
Look, I can't speak for the police union.
I certainly never will.
But I will, speak for myself.
And I am grateful
for the work of police officers
in our city,
especially over the last several days.
I mean, these these
these servants are tired.
They're working tirelessly.
They're drastically,
by the way, outnumbered
by the number of Ice agents,
and beyond,
that we have in our city right now.
And they deserve
all our full throated support.
Mayor, what would you say to somebody
says, look, these Ice agents,
they're also law enforcement.
They're doing a job
that they were sent to do
by President Trump and Secretary Nome.
They're not there
because they want to be there.
They're there
because they were told to be there.
And if people have an issue with it,
that's true.
They shouldn't be protesting
the Ice agents.
They should be protesting
outside the white House.
Well,
I think that's probably a fair point.
In that look,
of course you need to enforce laws.
Of course.
But there's also a requirement that you
carry out laws
and carry out enforcement
in a constitutional way.
And what we've seen is that
people are being plucked off the street
indiscriminately.
I take that back.
There's discrimination
only to the extent that they are Latino
or they are Somali,
and then it feels
indiscriminate thereafter.
We've got pregnant women
getting dragged through the street.
We've got,
you know, high schoolers
just getting
American citizens
by the way, getting taken away.
And so,
yeah,
I think it's a fair point to say, well,
these Ice agents are being
put in a horrible position
because they're asked to do things
that are not legal
or are unconscious attitudinal.
But here's the thing.
They're still doing them,
and we are still dealing
with the repercussions here in this city.
Minneapolis has been on this
glorious, amazing comeback,
and this is just setting this back
because we've got to deal with it.
And so,
no, you know, look, Minneapolis,
we're going to get through this.
We had 10,000 or something.
People protest peacefully yesterday.
We have thousands
and hundreds of thousands of people
that are standing up
for their neighbors right now.
We have people
that are not taking the bait
of this Trump administration,
because they all know we know
they're looking for any excuse
to come in with greater force
and occupy our city.
We're grinning down this bear.
We are doing right by our city
and the people in it,
and we're not backing down.
That's all the time I have.
I have a
we have a weekday show
every day, 5 to 7 eastern.
You both are welcome.
Any time this week, please come back.
Really appreciate your time today.
Thank you so much. Thank you."

#JoeRogan #ICE  #News","Here is how
podcaster Joe Rogan described it.
You don't want militarized
people in the streets
just roaming around snatching people up.
Many of which turn out
to actually be U.S.
citizens
that just don't have
their papers on them.
Are we really going to be the Gestapo?
Where's your papers?
Is that what we've come to?
I mean, that has also become
a big part of this so-called enforcement.
I mean,
Minneapolis is not a huge place, okay?
And they are absorbing thousands of
of federal officers,
more than any other deployment
that they've done so far.
And we are seeing these encounters
where you're seeing
federal officers,
maybe Ice agents, maybe Border
Patrol walking down the street
stopping people.
Sometimes because
they look Somali or
they look brown or whatever it is,
this is according to
those people who were stopped
and asking them, where are your papers?
Show me your papers. Where were you born?
That's the stuff that we're seeing.
And Americans
like Joe Rogan are concerned about it.
And I think part of it is, look,
Joe Rogan's identity does not depend
on, defending Donald Trump
and his administration
doing things that are in defensible.
And I see people all the time
bending themselves
on TV, bending themselves
into all sorts of pretzel shape because
because they subsist
from being a Trump supporter
and that's all they've got.
Joe Rogan,
I think, is speaking out of conviction,
speaking out of what he is seeing.
And I think it's reflective of what
a lot of Americans feel right now.
People are showing up at the streets
because they are pissed off
at what is happening in our country.
It is heartbreaking
to see these images in America.
We are the country
that's supposed to be an example
for the rest of the world.
And the things that are happening in
our streets
are the type of things that happen
in these third world countries,
and they do
bring all sorts of bad memories.
When you see these masked men
targeting people
and it's not just Minnesota,
I mean,
we remember the
the woman who got
pulled out of the street
in Boston by masked men.
We have seen pregnant women
drag in Minnesota.
We saw two young teenagers
who were working at target,
like so many of our children do.
Americans shouldn't
have a job while going to school
being pulled out.
I mean, while screaming, I'm a U.S.
citizen. I'm a U.S.
citizen because they looked Latino
and they were Latino.
That is un-American and unacceptable
and good for Joe Rogan for standing up
and denouncing it.
More of Trump supporters,
if they want him to be
a good president,
should be doing the same.
Let me play what he said
about the really good video
that we've been discussing. Listen.
It's complicated, obviously,
but it's also very ugly
to watch someone shoot a U.S.
citizen, especially a woman in the face.
When people say it's justifiable
because the car hit him,
it seemed like
she was kind of turned the car away.
Now, Joe,
what was really striking to me
about this Quinnipiac poll,
53% said it was unjustified
for the Ice agent to shoot Renee. Good.
But I was also really surprised by how
how this has penetrated.
82% of registered voters
say they saw that video.
So you're talking almost universal.
Yeah.
Impressions of what happened there. Is it
I don't know.
Are Republicans misreading the situation
or risking misreading the situation?
If anyone saw this segment right,
I had no problem defending the officer.
And I think Joe Rogan's factually
wrong about his assessment.
But I am a big Joe Rogan fan,
and I listen all the time,
and he is really,
emblematic of
one of the most successful
things Trump did in the campaign.
It was to engage podcasters.
And when a lot of people
who listen to that, that type of forum.
I have a conversation in my head
with Joe Rogan for hours every week.
I'm a big fan, right? I talk to him.
So when I hear him challenging
something that I believe,
you know,
or my gut reaction
is something I actually listen to him.
So I do think
this is a problem for Trump,
because I think he is
a very good barometer
of where people stand.
Again, this instance,
he might be factually wrong on.
I think he is,
but he is a good barometer
of where a lot of Trump supporters are.
And I would, I would,
I would have, you know,
they have the waffle House
indicator for a hurricane.
Like if the waffle House is closed,
there might be
there should be a Joe Rogan indicator
or a with us now,
CNN political commentators Karen
Finney and David Urban and friends,
what I'd like to do is not
relitigate the video or the events.
I actually want to talk about
how they're landing in comments
like the ones
David just made by Joe
Rogan, who seems to be saying,
I support the president's
immigration effort.
Notionally,
I do not like what
I'm seeing on the ground, though
he seems to be saying,
how pervasive do you
think that opinion is?
Yeah,
John, listen, I think
it is very pervasive, right?
Americans overwhelmingly voted
one of the president's strongest suits.
Americans overwhelmingly
voted for this president.
If you look at the numbers
and reasons given,
to secure the border
and crack down
on kind of the sieve that was
the border
under the Biden administration and
and this administration
effectively sealed
that border up and did that.
And then,
the president promised to go
after the bad hombres
and the drug dealers
and get those people out of America.
And, and, you know, the
there's a lot of support
for that in America.
What there isn't support for.
And the polling bears this out.
This isn't David Herbert's opinion.
This is the polling that bears out
that people do not want to see
what you're seeing on your screen
right now.
They do not want to hear
what Joe Rogan is saying.
They don't want to see masked men.
Geared up like,
Delta Force
walking down the streets of America,
asking people for their papers,
throwing them on the ground, zip tying,
people who are doing sheetrock,
you know, gardeners, nannies.
They don't want to see that. Right?
That's not what they voted for.
And so it is
it is really hurting this president.
And the numbers on an area
where he was strongest on immigration.
Strongest.
Now it's becoming a weaker point.
You know, Karen knows this,
President Obama deported lots of folks,
but he did it
in a completely different way.
The Obama administration
grabbed lots of folks
who just came across the border.
People who are who were,
who hadn't really integrated
into selves in the communities,
hadn't become people's neighbors.
And, you know, surprisingly,
are not surprisingly.
People don't like it
when ice shows up in their,
in their neighborhood
and take away people
that they have relationships with.
The Obama administration
was very effective
because they snatch people.
People didn't really know.
And in this case,
neighborhoods see this happening
and they don't like it.
And so I think the tactics
need to be addressed.
You know, I mean,
just factually, not just that
you don't even know
what I'm about to say, David.
So why don't you. Okay.
You know,
it's not just that they
this idea that somehow
if there's a difference between
it's not just taking people
that people know,
it is the violence,
it is the terrorizing of communities.
It is. There's a story in USA today.
A couple was getting back from a cruise
there in Miami
that ice or border
protection comes into their cabin,
pulls them out.
The the gentleman of the couple,
they're both American citizens.
He's a Coast Guard, veteran.
I mean, it's
the violence
that people are really reacting to.
And David is right.
I mean, this is really
people are very aware of this story,
and they're very aware of other stories
where they're seeing this armed militia
essentially acting
as though Americans have no rights.
We have the right to ask someone
to see their badge, who they are.
But these Ice officials are acting
as though you don't have that right.
And they're smashing
car doors, ripping
people out of their cars,
even when individuals are saying, wait,
I'm an American citizen,
let me get my ID, that is part.
It's a it's about the way
they are conducting this far beyond.
You know, it's
not just taking nannies and taking,
you know, day laborers.
It is now.
And and we saw an American citizen
get shot in the face.
So it's and it's as traumatizing,
frankly, as the George Floyd,
murder was so many years ago.
I do want to know,
I think you guys are agreeing,
basically or so.
So let's just take a minute
to acknowledge that even as,
you know, it
maybe started off as a treatment.
Yeah.
Let me just put up some of the numbers
that David Urban was talking about here.
Do you think the Minneapolis shooting
was justified?
Justified 35% not justified.
53%.
That's according to a new brand
new Quinnipiac poll.
And then approval of Ice in general
approve 40% disapprove 57%.
And once again,
I go back to just the idea
in the culture now, even among people
who may be more supportive
of the goals here,
you know, Zach
Bryant has a brand new album out.
You know, the biggest country
singer there is practically fills
stadiums.
And I just don't know
Zach Bryant's politics
one way or another.
But he comments on things being too woke
plenty.
He's got this line in this song.
The song's been out for a while,
but it was just released in the album.
I just want to play it right now.
And I'm going to come
down, you know,
the house on There's No More.
We got a telephone.
Kids are all getting home.
So who is this on David?
Who needs to change this?
David, if it is a problem.
Yeah, yeah, I know, John.
I, I think this
needs to start at the top.
I think the president
needs to be aware or,
are made more aware that,
you know,
maybe the numbers
are going to play it out,
but continue to have polling that shows
that the American people don't like this.
Listen, when you lose Joe Rogan, right,
you got a problem.
And, and I hope the white House
takes us to,
to to heart
that people
don't want to see this type of,
behavior from ice.
Listen,
everybody wants to get the bad guys
out of our country.
Everybody wants to fix
the immigration crisis in America.
But what is playing out in the streets,
to Karen's point, across
America is not something
that seems American. Right?
And the people who came here illegally,
we need to deport them.
But there's a way to do that.
And it doesn't appear
that the current situation
is making things better.
And and listen, we've got it.
We've got, you know, midterms coming up.
Do you think that anybody who's watching
this thinks that Republicans
should get more power or less power?
And, you know,
these these, these things are all,
are super important
for the administration
to take into account.
I think it needs to be dialed back.
I think they should take this, that
we can still enforce the laws
and have strict immigration control,
but do it in a different manner."
QS9im4o-l60,Six MN prosecutors resign over ICE shooting probe,20260114,CNN,363015,"At least half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned amid growing tensions between state and federal officials since the shooting on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.      

00:00  CNN Senior National Correspondent, Ryan Young is on the ground in Minneapolis.

04:11 CNN's Jake Tapper is joined by CNN Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig and CNN Correspondent, Pricilla Alvarez for a discussion.

                                                                                                                                                                                     #News #ice #minnesota","At least six top prosecutors in Minnesota&nbsp;
are resigning in protest of how the Trump&nbsp;&nbsp;
administration is handling last week's ICE&nbsp;
involved shooting in which an ICE agent killed&nbsp;&nbsp;
37-year-old Renee Nicole Good. This includes&nbsp;
Joe Thompson who served as acting US attorney&nbsp;&nbsp;
in Minnesota. source says this follows days of&nbsp;
pressure to focus the DOJ investigation not on the&nbsp;&nbsp;
actions of the ICE agent who shot and killed Renee&nbsp;
Good, but to focus the investigation on Good and&nbsp;&nbsp;
others around her. The New York Times reporting&nbsp;
this includes Good's widow. And indeed, Deputy&nbsp;&nbsp;
Attorney General Todd Blanch today released a&nbsp;
statement saying that the Justice Department does&nbsp;&nbsp;
not believe there's evidence to back a criminal&nbsp;
investigation into the ICE officer. Minnesota&nbsp;&nbsp;
Governor Tim Walls called the resignations a huge&nbsp;
loss, writing on X, quote, ""It's also the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;
sign that Trump is pushing nonpartisan career&nbsp;
professionals out of the Justice Department,&nbsp;&nbsp;
replacing them with his stance."" Tom Thompson,&nbsp;
by the way, the acting US attorney, previously&nbsp;&nbsp;
led the office's effort to tackle social services&nbsp;
fraud in the state. That's an issue that's high on&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Trump administration's priority list. We're&nbsp;
learning other resignations are also possible as&nbsp;&nbsp;
prosecutors weigh how to respond to this pressure&nbsp;
from their superiors in Washington DC. At the&nbsp;&nbsp;
same time, protests in Minneapolis continue to&nbsp;
escalate. Today, law enforcement agents fired&nbsp;&nbsp;
pepper balls as crowds blew whistles and shouted,&nbsp;
""Ice out now."" CNN crews on the scene say agents&nbsp;&nbsp;
surged into the area with at least 15 different&nbsp;
large SUVs. As agents returned to their vehicles,&nbsp;&nbsp;
flashbangs were also fired at the crowd of&nbsp;
protesters. Some protesters seen throwing&nbsp;&nbsp;
snowballs at agents. This is, of course, Minnesota&nbsp;
in January. Around 1,000 more US Customs and&nbsp;&nbsp;
Border Pro protection agents are expected to&nbsp;
deploy to Minneapolis. That's on top of 2,000&nbsp;&nbsp;
federal agents deployed to the area already.&nbsp;
In a Long Truth Social Post earlier today,&nbsp;&nbsp;
President Trump defended ICE agents, writing,&nbsp;
quote, ""Fear not, great people of Minnesota.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The day of reckoning and retribution is coming.""&nbsp;
Unquote. Let's go right to CNN's Ryan Young who's&nbsp;&nbsp;
on the ground in Minneapolis. And Ryan, you and&nbsp;
your crew were caught in the middle of some of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the unrest this afternoon. Tell us about it. Yeah,&nbsp;
we were caught right in the middle of that, Jake.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But right before I tell you about that, I want to&nbsp;
show you this scene right here. This is the people&nbsp;&nbsp;
who were left outside that federal building. These&nbsp;
folks are still angry and energized. They've been&nbsp;&nbsp;
yelling at the federal cars that go by. They've&nbsp;
been trying to take video of the people inside&nbsp;&nbsp;
those cars. But let us show you this video from&nbsp;
earlier today. This is what we saw. We saw the&nbsp;&nbsp;
whistles. We heard people screaming. When we ran&nbsp;
that direction, we saw this ice action happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We saw flashbangs. And they used irritant to try&nbsp;
to disperse this crowd. It happened so suddenly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hundreds of agents in this crowd trying to wrestle&nbsp;
certain people out of their cars. At some point,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we saw at least three people being detained.&nbsp;
But at the same time, these federal agents were&nbsp;&nbsp;
spraying themselves with that irritant. So, we saw&nbsp;
several agents getting sprayed with that irritant,&nbsp;&nbsp;
trying to react to it as these protesters, some&nbsp;
using their bodies to try to stop them from making&nbsp;&nbsp;
the arrest. We talked about the snowballs. They&nbsp;
definitely used that to try to stop them. And&nbsp;&nbsp;
there were people who physically tried to jump&nbsp;
on some of the cars that the agents were using&nbsp;&nbsp;
to try to get away from that neighborhood. After&nbsp;
that though, this area that was near where that&nbsp;&nbsp;
shooting happened with Renee Good, it went back&nbsp;
to being peaceful, but it was energized with more&nbsp;&nbsp;
people coming and surging into the neighborhood.&nbsp;
This is though the federal building where a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;
of people feel those agents are. You can see&nbsp;
them standing, some in the street, some trying&nbsp;&nbsp;
to block traffic. And when they do see people they&nbsp;
believe ICE agents, they sometimes physically try&nbsp;&nbsp;
to step into the street to stop them as well. But&nbsp;
today's action, I can tell you, Jake, was the most&nbsp;&nbsp;
energized and physically aggressive that we've&nbsp;
seen from both sides with the hundreds of agents&nbsp;&nbsp;
surging into that neighborhood today. People&nbsp;
running in the alleys to try to get away from the&nbsp;&nbsp;
situation. So many questions about what happens&nbsp;
next. Let's not forget more federal agents in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
area now than police officers on the street. All&nbsp;
right, Ryan Young, thanks so much. Let's discuss&nbsp;&nbsp;
all of this with CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, who&nbsp;
covers immigration issues expertly for us and&nbsp;&nbsp;
CNN senior legal analyst Ellie Honing. Ellie, let&nbsp;
me start with you. At least six top prosecutors&nbsp;&nbsp;
resigning in Minnesota. The New York Times reports&nbsp;
it's because they felt they were pressured to&nbsp;&nbsp;
investigate the widow of Renee Nicole Good, the&nbsp;
woman that was shot and killed by the ICE officer&nbsp;&nbsp;
last week. What What's your take on that, Jake?&nbsp;
If that proves out, it's an utter outrage. If the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Department of Justice has chosen to focus their&nbsp;
investigation not on the actions of the officer,&nbsp;&nbsp;
not on the actions of Renee Good at the scene of&nbsp;
the fatal shooting, but rather on the widow of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the deceased, that is indefensible. First of all,&nbsp;
whatever the widow of Renee Good may have done,&nbsp;&nbsp;
what her associations may have been is completely&nbsp;
and totally irrelevant to the question of whether&nbsp;&nbsp;
this was a justified legal self-defense shooting&nbsp;
by the ICE officer. Second of all, prosecutors&nbsp;&nbsp;
get leads on cases from all different places.&nbsp;
Sometimes a cooperator or an informant will give&nbsp;&nbsp;
you leads. Sometimes you'll read a story in the&nbsp;
newspaper. But to get a lead based on a person who&nbsp;&nbsp;
was fatally shot and say, ""Now, let's look at that&nbsp;
person's widow to see if they broke the law."" It's&nbsp;&nbsp;
utterly indefensible. And I think it lends context&nbsp;
to why these prosecutors chose to resign. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the White House press secretary referred to the&nbsp;
deceased Rene Good as a quote deranged lunatic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, it's not as though uh empathy uh is in&nbsp;
excess supply over at the White House. Priscilla,&nbsp;&nbsp;
what do you know about what's happening behind&nbsp;
the scenes at the Department of Homeland Security?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yeah, Jake, look, there's mixed emotions&nbsp;
at the Department of Homeland Security&nbsp;&nbsp;
among these agents. Some are frustrated&nbsp;
with this operation, with this mission,&nbsp;&nbsp;
others supported. And I'm talking here about the&nbsp;
3,000 now agents who have deployed to Minneapolis&nbsp;&nbsp;
from all over the country. The two agencies&nbsp;
that I'm talking about here, Immigration and&nbsp;&nbsp;
Customs Enforcement involved in that shooting last&nbsp;
week and US Customs and Border Protection. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am told that they are doing targeted operations&nbsp;
in Minneapolis, meaning that they know who they're&nbsp;&nbsp;
going after. But these are two agencies who&nbsp;
have had simmering feuds and tensions over the&nbsp;&nbsp;
years. And if people are noticing that there's&nbsp;
different tactics on the ground in Minneapolis,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the reason is because each of these agencies&nbsp;
tend to take a different approach and how they&nbsp;&nbsp;
they do immigration enforcement. For example, CBP&nbsp;
typically on the US Mexico border. So it creates&nbsp;&nbsp;
this confusing situation and can lend itself to&nbsp;
those feuds reigniting in this city at a time&nbsp;&nbsp;
when there are thousands of officers there. But&nbsp;
I do want to note, Jake, we should take a step&nbsp;&nbsp;
back here because what is remarkable was happening&nbsp;
in Minneapolis and Minnesota is that this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;
president's immigration vision centering in one&nbsp;
place. Take it in totality. You have stripping&nbsp;&nbsp;
federal funds or the threat to do that. Uh the&nbsp;
threat to denaturalize the Somali nationals that&nbsp;&nbsp;
are in Minnesota, flooding the zone with agents,&nbsp;
sending more prosecutors to prosecute those US&nbsp;&nbsp;
citizens who are impeding on law enforcement. If&nbsp;
you look at everything that the administration is&nbsp;&nbsp;
doing, this is the playbook that they have wanted&nbsp;
since the early days and that they are now doing&nbsp;&nbsp;
in Minneapolis and what they want to continue&nbsp;
doing in other blue cities. Ellie, this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;
the latest instance of the Justice Department and&nbsp;
the FBI u continuing to hemorrhage experienced&nbsp;&nbsp;
veterans and career prosecutors because of the&nbsp;
way they are doing business. We remember when&nbsp;&nbsp;
there were those mass resignations after that&nbsp;
deal, that sketchy deal with Mayor Eric Adams&nbsp;&nbsp;
was struck. All those prosecutors in New York&nbsp;
just resigned because they they didn't like what&nbsp;&nbsp;
was being done. What does this mass resignation,&nbsp;
these six prosecutors in Minnesota, what what does&nbsp;&nbsp;
that say to you? Well, Jake, just for perspective,&nbsp;
the entire US Attorney's Office for the District&nbsp;&nbsp;
of Minnesota has about 7070 prosecutors. So when&nbsp;
the number two person and six total prosecutors&nbsp;&nbsp;
resign, that's 10% of that office leaving in&nbsp;
protest in one fell swoop. And broader perspective&nbsp;&nbsp;
here, if you think of the loss of talent and&nbsp;
experience that's happened at DOJ, people who've&nbsp;&nbsp;
been fired or pushed out over the last year, you&nbsp;
mentioned the Eric Adams case. Several experienced&nbsp;&nbsp;
prosecutors left then. Prosecutors were forced out&nbsp;
over their refusal to indict Jim Comey and Leticia&nbsp;&nbsp;
James in the Eastern District of Virginia.&nbsp;
You had prosecutors, anyone who touched the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jack Smith prosecution was fired. Anyone FBI&nbsp;
agent or US attorney who worked on a January&nbsp;&nbsp;
6th prosecution has been pushed out. So, we're&nbsp;
talking about dozens upon dozens of prosecutors,&nbsp;&nbsp;
hundreds of experienced FBI agents. And DOJ&nbsp;
is no different than any other organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whether you're talking about a law firm, a bank,&nbsp;
a media organization, a football team, if you lose&nbsp;&nbsp;
that much talent all at once, it's going to show&nbsp;
in the actual performance of that organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yeah. And that organization is staffed and was&nbsp;
tasked with keeping the American people safe."

#ICE #HomelandSecurity #News","Secretary Gnome also told reporters yesterday&nbsp;
that ICE may ask people to quote validate their&nbsp;&nbsp;
identity when asked about Americans carrying proof&nbsp;
of citizenship. Can you clarify what exactly that&nbsp;&nbsp;
means? Do American citizens as of now need to&nbsp;
carry their passports or other uh immigration&nbsp;&nbsp;
documents to show that they're citizens? I am so&nbsp;
glad you asked this question because I think that&nbsp;&nbsp;
there's a lot of confusion there about about&nbsp;
this. We have incredibly targeted immigration&nbsp;&nbsp;
enforcement operations. So what's happening there&nbsp;
is there is reasonable suspicion if somebody is in&nbsp;&nbsp;
the vicinity of this operation of this target uh&nbsp;
then they could be asked for their identification.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We've been vindicated uh by this by the Supreme&nbsp;
Court September of 2025. You all saw a case out of&nbsp;&nbsp;
Los Angeles where they said we can use reasonable&nbsp;
suspicion. I think I've seen a lot on this network&nbsp;&nbsp;
and other places where they're talking about&nbsp;
this is racially based. Absolutely not. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;
racial animous is no place in DHS and is of course&nbsp;
not used. We're using what is protected under the&nbsp;&nbsp;
fourth amendment of the US Constitution.&nbsp;
All right, let's dive a little bit deeper&nbsp;&nbsp;
into that. I want to play this video of a recent&nbsp;
incident in Minnesota that has received attention.
Do you have an ID on you, ma'am? I don't need&nbsp;
ID to walk around in in my city. This is Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do you have some ID then, please? I don't need If&nbsp;
not, we're going to put you in the vehicle. We're&nbsp;&nbsp;
going to ID you, please. I am US citizen. I don't&nbsp;
need to carry around a ID in my home. Where were&nbsp;&nbsp;
you born? This is my home. Where were you born?&nbsp;
Minneapolis. This is my home. So that video was&nbsp;&nbsp;
filmed by a woman who as you heard said she is&nbsp;
a US citizen. Why exactly was she stopped? Was&nbsp;&nbsp;
there reasonable suspicion which is a legal bar&nbsp;
as you noted that a crime was committed in that&nbsp;&nbsp;
situation and why was he asking her where are you&nbsp;
born? Like what was he basing that on? Sure. So&nbsp;&nbsp;
either this is and I haven't seen this video&nbsp;
before. So there could be two circumstances&nbsp;&nbsp;
here. Either he was this is a target operation&nbsp;
and she's around the vicinity of it around the&nbsp;&nbsp;
target. There's reasonable suspicion because&nbsp;
there might be a descriptor or she could be 5'6&nbsp;&nbsp;
and they're looking for somebody who's 5'6. That&nbsp;
could be part of it. They're looking for somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh that could be part of it. The other piece of it&nbsp;
is it could be I don't know if she was obstructing&nbsp;&nbsp;
law enforcement, uh if she was assaulting law&nbsp;
enforcement prior to this, but they either had&nbsp;&nbsp;
those Title 8 authorities under the US Code 1357&nbsp;
or they had that reasonable suspicion. What do&nbsp;&nbsp;
you say to to those who watch that and other&nbsp;
videos that they're seeing themselves? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;
this is not just the mainstream media. Um, this&nbsp;
is people are seeing these videos and they're&nbsp;&nbsp;
concerned and they're concerned that a place&nbsp;
like Minnesota is turning into a police state and&nbsp;&nbsp;
they're going up to US citizens asking for ID and&nbsp;
and you know using Yeah, I I think that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;
a lot of fearongering going on I think by the&nbsp;
media. I think Hold on. Let me just correct you&nbsp;&nbsp;
right there. Let me just They're They're watching&nbsp;
these videos and using their independence of mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's not the media. No, actually it is the media&nbsp;
and we're seeing it time and time again by saying&nbsp;&nbsp;
things like the police state. What we're seeing&nbsp;
is rampant violence against our law enforcement,&nbsp;&nbsp;
highly coordinated. We have our legal authorities.&nbsp;
When individuals see videos like that, you have to&nbsp;&nbsp;
ask the question, was this individual obstructing&nbsp;
law enforcement, which is a federal crime? Were&nbsp;&nbsp;
they assaulting law enforcement, which is a&nbsp;
felony? Were any of those in instances occurring&nbsp;&nbsp;
before this video was cut? Cuz you saw a very&nbsp;
shortcut. And that's what I'm talking about the&nbsp;&nbsp;
media. But you have to look at the polling, right?&nbsp;
This isn't the media. This is actual polling that&nbsp;&nbsp;
says, ""Hey, I like what ICE is doing in terms of&nbsp;
its its target. We want to get criminals off the&nbsp;&nbsp;
street who don't belong in the country."" But&nbsp;
51% say ICE makes cities less safe. Just 31%&nbsp;&nbsp;
say it makes cities more safe. On the Renee Good&nbsp;
case you brought up, 26% of Americans viewed the&nbsp;&nbsp;
shooting as an appropriate use of force, while&nbsp;
56% called it an inappropriate use of force. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;
are you willing to consider in some cases ICE&nbsp;
has gone too far and is losing American support?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pamela, in the last five weeks, we have arrested&nbsp;
2,500 criminal legal aliens off of the streets&nbsp;&nbsp;
of Minneapolis. If I can finish, if I can make&nbsp;
my point, I appreciate you having me, but I do&nbsp;&nbsp;
want to be able to make my point. Sure. The point&nbsp;
of the matter is I have not seen CNN cover who&nbsp;&nbsp;
some of those individuals are. An individual from&nbsp;
Ecuador who he murdered his three-month-old son.&nbsp;&nbsp;
An individual who is perpetuating uh human slavery&nbsp;
and human trafficking. scores and scores of&nbsp;&nbsp;
murders, child pedophiles. Why does the media not&nbsp;
talk about that? We continue to see that people&nbsp;&nbsp;
love to demonize law enforcement, vilify them as&nbsp;
they're facing a thousand% increase in assaults&nbsp;&nbsp;
against them. And yet, we're not talking about&nbsp;
the great work that they're doing on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The fact that they are risking their lives day in&nbsp;
and day out to get these criminals off the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;
gang members known as suspected terrorists.&nbsp;
These are all the people that we've arrested&nbsp;&nbsp;
in Minneapolis and DHS has and Secretary Nome,&nbsp;
President Trump have done a phenomenal job of&nbsp;&nbsp;
trying to give people transparency on who we are&nbsp;
arresting. And yet we're standing here talking&nbsp;&nbsp;
about relitigating cases over and over. Well, a&nbsp;
US citizen was killed by an ICE officer. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;
fair. I talked about I talked about the polls.&nbsp;
It's a fair question to say, are you losing&nbsp;&nbsp;
American support? But Wolf, if I want to let you&nbsp;
please. No one supports attacking or killing a law&nbsp;&nbsp;
enforcement officer. Nobody supports that. But&nbsp;
if I may say, you all have said really laying&nbsp;&nbsp;
the feet at that ICE enforcement officer. We said&nbsp;
that we said that this was domestic terrorism for&nbsp;&nbsp;
a reason. This individual used a deadly weapon&nbsp;
against our ICE law enforcement officer. That&nbsp;&nbsp;
is and will be charged in any of the cases. We&nbsp;
saw 15 of these cases over the past week alone&nbsp;&nbsp;
in Minneapolis. Those will be charged as domestic&nbsp;
terrorists. But when she called this 37year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;
mother of three who was driving that car a&nbsp;
domestic terrorist, that really was outrageous.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We say it was an act of domestic terrorism. In&nbsp;
no way is that outrageous what we saw on the&nbsp;&nbsp;
ground there. She had been stalking and harassing&nbsp;
law enforcement throughout the morning and then&nbsp;&nbsp;
she went on to use her car as a deadly weapon.&nbsp;
That's she was driving by after dropping off a&nbsp;&nbsp;
six-year-old boy. That's just simply not true. I&nbsp;
have the facts on the ground. And I I mean if you&nbsp;&nbsp;
look at it for the I have more information you can&nbsp;
release to give the public a better understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If I can give you the facts of what happened that&nbsp;
morning at 9:30 a.m. Central time. This is where&nbsp;&nbsp;
that incident occurred in Minneapolis. This&nbsp;
individual for hours before had been stalking&nbsp;&nbsp;
and harassing law enforcement impeding operations.&nbsp;
At the time of that incident, our law enforcement&nbsp;&nbsp;
approached this individual's vehicle as she was&nbsp;
blocking in our law enforcement. That is a federal&nbsp;&nbsp;
crime. They asked her to get out of the car to&nbsp;
stop obstructing law enforcement. You saw from&nbsp;&nbsp;
the video that her partner had been walking around&nbsp;
harassing the law enforcement officer. Our officer&nbsp;&nbsp;
was in front of her. She gunned the vehicle and&nbsp;
that's when things turned dangerous and deadly. If&nbsp;&nbsp;
you don't listen to lawful commands of federal law&nbsp;
enforcement, if you use your vehicle as a weapon,&nbsp;&nbsp;
that is absolutely an act domestic. Well, hold on&nbsp;
really quick. I mean, you you just mentioned he&nbsp;&nbsp;
stepped in front of the vehicle and there is no&nbsp;
confirmation. I mean, there have been different&nbsp;&nbsp;
analysis of this vehicle and of course, we would&nbsp;
love more facts to fill in the picture. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but she's also turning the wheel and he did step&nbsp;
in front of the vehicle as part of this. Is that&nbsp;&nbsp;
part of the training for ICE agents in an during&nbsp;
an encounter with the vehicle when you're trying&nbsp;&nbsp;
to be when they're being blocked when you're&nbsp;
being impeded? When you're cars were going by,&nbsp;&nbsp;
cars were being you're not seeing the full video.&nbsp;
There were cars behind this individual that could&nbsp;&nbsp;
not get through. So again, we're talking about&nbsp;
manipulative editing and only showing we're only&nbsp;&nbsp;
showing part of the Pamela. There's a very welcome&nbsp;
any more evidence. If I could say one thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;
there's a very simple solution here. Tim Wallace&nbsp;
and Mayor Fry should let us into their jails.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Those 1400 individuals, those criminal legal&nbsp;
aliens who have already had their due process,&nbsp;&nbsp;
let us in those jails. Let us take those&nbsp;
murderers, those rapists, those child pedophiles&nbsp;&nbsp;
out. That would simply solve the solution. work&nbsp;
with state and local law enforcement. That is&nbsp;&nbsp;
what we're asking. Down in Florida, there's been&nbsp;
40,000 arrests of criminal legal aliens. We've&nbsp;&nbsp;
seen peace. We've seen public safety. That's what&nbsp;
we should be seeing across the nation. Trisha,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I want you to listen and watch what your boss, uh,&nbsp;
the Secretary of Homeland Security, Trisha Gnome,&nbsp;&nbsp;
uh, excuse me, uh, Secretary, Secretary Gnome,&nbsp;
said yesterday alongside another video of a&nbsp;&nbsp;
recent encounter in Minnesota. Listen to this. The&nbsp;
officers that we have out there are very highly&nbsp;&nbsp;
trained and skilled specific for the operations&nbsp;
that they're doing. Uh they're utilizing uh the&nbsp;&nbsp;
most gifted individuals on these operations to go&nbsp;
out and to do enforcement because many times if&nbsp;&nbsp;
they're going after murderers and we also saw that&nbsp;
video of a woman being pulled out of her car as&nbsp;&nbsp;
she was trying to simply go to the doctor. Is that&nbsp;
what that is? She was not going to the doctor. Is&nbsp;&nbsp;
what you're seeing there are these the officers&nbsp;
are trained to do. They cut off her seatelt.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They dragged her out of the car and took her out.&nbsp;
This individual was actually arrested because she&nbsp;&nbsp;
was time and time again impeding law enforcement&nbsp;
officers. Again, a small snippet of this video.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Uh so she was an agitator intentionally. Again,&nbsp;
trying to impede federal law enforcement officers,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which is a federal crime. It is a felony. How&nbsp;
do you know for certainty though that she wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;
just caught up in the protests and the traffic and&nbsp;
the chaos and was trying to get to how you know?&nbsp;&nbsp;
She was doing this time and time again, over and&nbsp;
over and over again. We've talked to federal law&nbsp;&nbsp;
enforcement on the ground. We talked to their&nbsp;
supervisors in this case. We knew exactly what&nbsp;&nbsp;
happened here and she'll be charged as such.&nbsp;
I want to ask you about the recruitment. You&nbsp;&nbsp;
talked about, you know, the training they get.&nbsp;
Um, there's an ICE recruiting poster and it read,&nbsp;&nbsp;
quote, ""We'll have our home again that's gone&nbsp;
viral. That phrase is cited as having ties to&nbsp;&nbsp;
white nationalist groups in the US and Canada&nbsp;
and a database of symbols maintained by the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.""&nbsp;
I want to let you explain that. And also,&nbsp;&nbsp;
even if this is not intentional, do you denounce&nbsp;
this if it's connect if if this could be seen as&nbsp;&nbsp;
a dog whistle to white supremacist? Well, have&nbsp;
our home again is now a white nationalist dog&nbsp;&nbsp;
whistle. I mean, what are they even What is that&nbsp;
a dog whistle to? Well, it's I just by the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I knew I had a feeling you would ask me about&nbsp;
this. I was I would let you explain poems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's a lot of attention. There's plenty. Yes.&nbsp;
And you know, there's no reason that we should&nbsp;&nbsp;
be manufacturing outrage. There are plenty of&nbsp;
plenty. It it is actually there are plenty of&nbsp;&nbsp;
policy disagreements we should be having and I I&nbsp;
really believe we should be having manufacturing&nbsp;&nbsp;
fake outreach is not that. There are plenty of&nbsp;
poems. There are plenty of songs. There are plenty&nbsp;&nbsp;
of books with the same title. And the fact that&nbsp;
they people would like to cherrypick something of&nbsp;&nbsp;
white nationalism to make some sort of connection&nbsp;
to DHS law enforcement. Well, it's no wonder we're&nbsp;&nbsp;
seeing such vast rampant assaults against our law&nbsp;
enforcement. It's no wonder Secretary Gnome is&nbsp;&nbsp;
facing so many threats against her life. I am Tom&nbsp;
Holman across the board is because of garbage like&nbsp;&nbsp;
this and people choosing to manufacture outrage.&nbsp;
I think it's quite frankly embarrassing. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wanted to give you the chance to respond. Again,&nbsp;
this came from the Global Project Against Hate and&nbsp;&nbsp;
Extremism. Thank you very much for coming on,&nbsp;
Trisha Mclofflin. We appreciate your time to&nbsp;&nbsp;
give DHS's side of the story. Absolutely. Thank&nbsp;
you for having me. Thanks very much for coming"
QpaCL_6Y2D4,New video analysis sheds light on Minneapolis ICE shooting,20260117,CNN,1108445,"A new video analysis from the New York Times sheds light on the moments before the ICE shooting in Minneapolis.

0:00 New NYT analysis of moments before ICE shooting
1:12 NY Times visual investigations reporter Devon Lum
6:14 What is the sound recorded by the agent's phone?
#ICEShooting #Minneapolis #News","There's still many questions, outstanding&nbsp;
questions about what happened in the critical&nbsp;&nbsp;
moments leading up to the killing of Renee Good&nbsp;
during a confrontation with ICE officers last&nbsp;&nbsp;
week. As additional videos of the shootings&nbsp;
continue to surface, the New York Times is&nbsp;&nbsp;
out with a very detailed new analysis, syncing up&nbsp;
multiple multiple videos from different angles,&nbsp;&nbsp;
going frame by frame and creating really the&nbsp;
fullest video image picture of what transpired.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here's a portion of their analysis centering&nbsp;
around the position of the officer in relation&nbsp;&nbsp;
to Miss Good's vehicle. That's from the New York&nbsp;
Times. The cell phone is focused squarely on&nbsp;&nbsp;
Miss Good. She looks down, shifts into drive,&nbsp;
and begins turning to the right away. Cut to&nbsp;&nbsp;
this high angle and zoom in. We can make out the&nbsp;
agent's body and his arm filming. We can also see&nbsp;&nbsp;
at the same time he's beginning to lift his other&nbsp;
arm. On these cameras, we can see what's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;
around Agent Ross. The other agent is yelling&nbsp;
orders and reaching into Miss Good's SUV. Her&nbsp;&nbsp;
front tire spins as she continues turning right.&nbsp;
Agent Ross is at least a few feet away from Miss&nbsp;&nbsp;
Good's SUV. He does not appear to move out of the&nbsp;
way. And I'm joined by now by one of the reporters&nbsp;&nbsp;
who worked on that video analysis from the New&nbsp;
York Times, Devon Lum. Um Devon, so that video&nbsp;&nbsp;
that we just saw, what what is the significance to&nbsp;
you in that? Right. So, what we're seeing in that&nbsp;&nbsp;
video is the agent who eventually shoots Renee&nbsp;
Good moving from his position near his own SUV&nbsp;&nbsp;
in front of her vehicle as it's moving. So, law&nbsp;
enforcement agents are are not instructed to do&nbsp;&nbsp;
that. They're they're told the direct opposite&nbsp;
because it places them in danger uh like we&nbsp;&nbsp;
see in this. It also I mean what you're saying in&nbsp;
the in the video is that she is turning the wheel&nbsp;&nbsp;
um almost like a three-point turn. She had backed&nbsp;
up and now she's turning. Does it indicate in the&nbsp;&nbsp;
video that that she was I mean that this is one&nbsp;
of the questions the president said that she ran&nbsp;&nbsp;
over the officer that's clearly didn't occur.&nbsp;
Um was she aiming for him? Was she a trying&nbsp;&nbsp;
to turn away? Right. So we can see in the video&nbsp;
there's a split second where you know the tires&nbsp;&nbsp;
of her car are pointed towards the agent. But&nbsp;
it's not because she's angling those tires at&nbsp;&nbsp;
the agent. And it's like you said, she's in the&nbsp;
middle of completing a three-point turn. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;
she was reversing with the wheel turned all the&nbsp;
way to the left to flip the the front of the car&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the right and was in the process of turning&nbsp;
to the right. So, if you play the video further,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you can see those wheels are moving away from&nbsp;
the agent. There's also the question of was the&nbsp;&nbsp;
the agent uh who killed Mgood was was he actually&nbsp;
hit that? We've seen his cell phone camera video.&nbsp;&nbsp;
there seems to be, you know, a jostling at the&nbsp;
camera. Whether that's him it smashing against&nbsp;&nbsp;
the car, I'm not sure. Well, I want to show&nbsp;
this other video uh that's that's part of your&nbsp;&nbsp;
analysis. This is also the moment many have&nbsp;
said looks like Agent Ross getting run over,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and it does when watched at full speed.&nbsp;
But looking more closely, we can see
we had some problem with that. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
can we try to react that and play&nbsp;
that again? Cuz that's important.
This is also the moment many have said&nbsp;
looks like Agent Ross getting run over,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and it does when watched at full&nbsp;
speed. But looking more closely,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we can see in multiple angles that&nbsp;
there's a visible gap between the&nbsp;&nbsp;
vehicle and his legs, indicating his feet&nbsp;
are positioned outside the SUV's path.
The agent's left hand is still against the vehicle&nbsp;
and gripping his phone. We see as he fires, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
recording the clouds and the trees overhead. It's&nbsp;
not because the agent is knocked to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The other angle shows he's still standing,&nbsp;&nbsp;
continuing to maintain his grip on&nbsp;
his phone and his gun. And we see a&nbsp;&nbsp;
clear and growing gap between his body&nbsp;
and the SUV as he fires a second shot.
And that there's four shots, your report. There's&nbsp;
three three shots. Yeah, that's correct. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;
so the the second and the third shot, which&nbsp;
I think we have a freeze frame maybe of or&nbsp;&nbsp;
or reacking of the the second and the third shot.&nbsp;
Those that's from a different angle than the first&nbsp;&nbsp;
shot and is is it directly into the window. So,&nbsp;
you know, we're not able to establish the direct&nbsp;&nbsp;
path of the bullet of each bullet that was shot,&nbsp;
but we what we can see in the video is by the&nbsp;&nbsp;
time that he's firing his second and third shot,&nbsp;
there's a clear and growing gap between where he's&nbsp;&nbsp;
positioned and where Renee Good has been turning,&nbsp;
right? So, uh the first shot looks to be a little&nbsp;&nbsp;
bit more directly uh potentially through the&nbsp;
windshield, but again, we can't establish that&nbsp;&nbsp;
through through the visuals at this moment. But&nbsp;
at the moment of the first shot, he has his hand&nbsp;&nbsp;
on the vehicle as it's turning and pushing this&nbsp;
direction and is pivoting away, right? And you&nbsp;&nbsp;
can really see that pivoting motion when he fires&nbsp;
the second and third shot. And that gap continues&nbsp;&nbsp;
to grow as she drives past and it becomes more of&nbsp;
a firing toward the side. I want to play another&nbsp;&nbsp;
piece of your analysis that shows uh well, let's&nbsp;
let's play this next one. It's at this point&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the cell phone video where it first looks and&nbsp;
sounds like the agent's getting knocked violently.
On the other camera, we can see what's happening.&nbsp;
Here is Agent Ross aiming his Miss Good. And here&nbsp;&nbsp;
is his outstretched arm leaning toward her&nbsp;
vehicle, which is barely visible behind the&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tahoe. His phone, which is gripped in his left&nbsp;
hand, flips over when the agent's hand, lands on&nbsp;&nbsp;
the front of the vehicle. There's an audible thud&nbsp;
when it hits. The camera rotates up towards the&nbsp;&nbsp;
sky. Again, while it appears the agent's getting&nbsp;
knocked over, we can see that's not the case from&nbsp;&nbsp;
the other angle, which shows he's standing with&nbsp;
his hand near the headlight, his torso and legs&nbsp;&nbsp;
away from the vehicle. So that knock in that in in&nbsp;
the agent's camera, which when you first hear it,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it sounds like he's being hit. That that's&nbsp;
actually the phone in his hand making impact&nbsp;&nbsp;
with a car. Yeah. It's it's really important to&nbsp;
acknowledge that the video that came out last&nbsp;&nbsp;
Friday um from the perspective of the agent was&nbsp;
not being recorded by a body camera. It was the&nbsp;&nbsp;
cell phone that he was holding in his hand. So&nbsp;
when we see some some ruffling, some darkness,&nbsp;&nbsp;
some shaking, it's not that he's being knocked&nbsp;
back. It's that his hand, which is holding the&nbsp;&nbsp;
camera, is being moved around by himself as well&nbsp;
as the motion of the car. So when we hear a thud&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the camera is flipping upward, you know,&nbsp;
pretend you're filming uh holding a camera&nbsp;&nbsp;
like this and something is coming towards you and&nbsp;
you want to put your hand on that thing in front&nbsp;&nbsp;
of you, the camera is going to flip up, right?&nbsp;
And so when it makes contact with the car which&nbsp;&nbsp;
is turning and driving, it's going to push back in&nbsp;
this direction. So that's what we see when we see,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, the his his face and and the, you know,&nbsp;
the shift from facing the car to upward. It's not&nbsp;&nbsp;
him being knocked over. It's the motion is on the&nbsp;
vehicle and it moves toward his chest as the car&nbsp;&nbsp;
is moving and his but his legs are are Yes. So&nbsp;
he's he's he's positioned back kind of leaning&nbsp;&nbsp;
forward like this, but his legs are out of the&nbsp;
path of the vehicle and he's trained on Renee Good&nbsp;&nbsp;
that entire time. If you watch the video, his his&nbsp;
shooting hand is remarkably stable throughout that&nbsp;&nbsp;
entire portion. And you know, even after uh this&nbsp;
contact with his hand, despite being on a slippery&nbsp;&nbsp;
road uh and making contact with the vehicle, he's&nbsp;
still on his feet. You know, he's sliding a little&nbsp;&nbsp;
bit, but he hasn't been knocked to the ground. He&nbsp;
hasn't lost a grip on his camera and he has not,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you know, stopped aiming directly at Miss&nbsp;
Good. Uh Deon Lum, appreciate it. Thanks very&nbsp;&nbsp;
much. You can find the full video on the New York&nbsp;
Times's homepage. It's fascinating. Take a look."
icoNCo5Za_0,Woman dragged from car by ICE agents speaks out for first time,20260120,CNN,382944,"Aliya Rahman speaks out for the first time after being dragged from her car by ICE agents in Minneapolis while trying to get to a doctor’s appointment.

#Minneapolis #ICE  #News","I'm disabled.
By now,
you've probably seen this video
from Minneapolis.
A woman being dragged from her car
while driving through
a protest against President
Trump's immigration crackdown.
She was arrested
two blocks from where
an Ice agent shot
and killed Rene Good a week before.
You heard her screaming.
I'm disabled.
As agents carried her by her arms
and her legs from her own car.
Tonight we know her name.
Alia. Rahman.
In just a minute,
you'll hear from her for the first time.
In an exclusive interview,
Alia says she was never part
of the protest that day.
She was simply just trying to go
to her doctor's appointment.
But in the statement,
the Homeland Security Department
called Rahman a, quote, agitator,
adding she, quote,
ignored multiple commands by an officer
to move her vehicle away from the scene.
She was arrested for obstruction.
The Minneapolis police
chief, Brian O'Hara.
He watched the video.
He sees it differently.
Obviously, I don't know why
law enforcement officers
initially approached the vehicle.
It pisses me off to see that,
to see men doing that
to a woman who's disabled.
It pisses me off.
If those cops works for
me, they'd have a problem right now
with me now.
Ali Rahman and her attorney,
Alexia Van Brunt.
Thank you both for being here.
Ali, I want to start with you
because this has been viral.
People have seen this
video over and over again.
People have many opinions.
This is what happened to you.
It is your life. It is your journey.
But the government,
they're calling you an agitator.
So can you just help me understand?
Walk me through
what happened in those moments
before these agents
dragged you from your car?
Yeah.
Thank you for having me.
We have to go and say that this thing.
I'm really happy
that you asked this question. Right.
Because I have been so concerned
that folks might be distracted
from the real issue at hand.
But instead of debating why,
I proceeded slowly
through a militarized traffic jam
for pedestrians and a cacophony
of conflicting instructions,
I was on my way to the doctor.
I was on a main road
that is a direct road
from my house to the parking lot.
Suddenly there's traffic in the road.
There are vehicles, blocking it.
I had vehicles that later
I understood where I saw vehicles,
people around me
trying to understand what to do.
And I think that, you see, the rest.
So you weren't.
I mean, again,
you see the
federal agents saying something to you
before you were dragged out.
They say,
but you were given
what they call repeated warnings.
I just heard
you say this
cacophony of conflicting commands.
What were they saying to you?
What did you understand to be happening?
Well, I think I didn't understand
what was happening. Right.
I am a disabled person
who has autism, right?
That is a big piece of this.
But I think even someone who doesn't have
the kind of auditory
processing challenges
I do would not know what to do
with the sentence move.
I will break your effing window.
And then back and forth between move!
Get out!
Trying to open my door.
More threats of breaking a window,
which I don't understand.
The functional purpose of an eye.
It's not a warning.
It's a threat of violence
that really shouldn't
be packaged with an instruction.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm happy to tell you
about what my ears hear
in that situation, but in my ears,
my autism also comes with an auditory
sorting challenge, where
multiple human voices
that like a loud party
or on a chaotic street,
all sound like there's
the person talking to me.
So that's one reason,
you know,
you see me
looking and trying to identify
which lips are talking to me.
But of course, that's not possible
because ice officers wear things
that cover their mouths and faces
except for their eyes. Right.
So it's it is so informative
for you to explain.
What it was personally
like for you, for us
to have watched the video
and now to understand
at least a part
of what you were experiencing in that,
because there is a conflicting report
from their vantage point
that tries to explain
what you were thinking or feeling,
and you've done it yourself.
But I want to be clear.
You say you were not there
to protest Ice.
You were there on your way
to an appointment
and you stopped in the traffic.
And I got you conflicting
reports and commands.
Were you there to protest Ice?
Had you ever protested
Ice before in that arena?
No.
So when you went that day
and you were detained, as you said,
what was that like for you
once you were,
what happened after they took you?
Number one?
I experienced a very specific set
of dehumanization practices
during the six stages of detention
and processing that I counted
before I went unconscious
and was taken out in an ambulance.
Number two,
during every one of those stages,
I clocked
Ice agents doing things that indicated
they were not aware of what their job was
or how to do it.
Lots of where's this?
What do we do next? You know,
agents had to stop at all five stages.
Agents had to stop.
Ask someone else what to do.
Where basic things were.
There were local staff
who seemed to know some of that thing,
but I distinctly heard
two of them at one point
say to each other,
we don't want to step on ice toes.
And I was trying to get medical care.
And the third is that the
practices I experienced
with, like, my own body, ears and eyes
do not make sense to me as an immigration
or public safety strategy
because they make things less safe.
And honestly,
I was not separated
from a citizen of any other country.
I think people believe
this is just immigrants in there
and it is not.
I was told that if I were a normal human,
nothing would be a problem.
They said that we have now heard from.
Oh yeah,
you know,
when I ask for disability accommodations.
And I said, did
anybody bring my cane with me
from the car?
I need that to walk.
Not stand, but walk.
It's like balance is bad.
They said there's no cane here.
They stood me up and like
irons and said, well, push my back.
Walk.
You can do it.
Nobody said,
maybe we should find something else.
There was no medical screening.
I was never once asked for my ID.
I've been told
I was under arrest and never charged.
Wow. And when. If.
Yeah, I sat there and,
somebody finally noticed
I was, you know,
not able to balance even sitting.
And they said,
I think there might have been
a wheelchair around here
the other day because I kept asking,
can you at least get a wheelchair?
People said,
I don't even know if we have those.
That's not the answer to that question.
That's never should be happening.
And when they put me in the wheelchair
finally,
an officer said,
well, you were driving right?
So your legs do work.
What?
You know,
I refrained from saying,
have you ever friends and saying,
have you ever seen a handicapped
parking spot, sir? What?
But the thing is,
right, people are going to say, well,
none of that stuff is illegal.
It's just me.
But I have read too many books
to think that things are okay
when this level of dehumanization
and this is happening
because it means officers
are probably trying
to get through their day
when they have been given orders
that are not righteous
and they actually hurt people.
And I have to ask you
and all you have to forgive me.
My my own sister is mobility impaired.
And she drives with the assistance.
Had to accommodate and,
adapt her car so many different times
to be able to still function and live
in the standard that she wants to.
I get emotional thinking about it,
but my blood is boiling.
Thinking about.
Yeah that experience.
So can you describe it
from the legal perspective of it?
Yeah.
She has been was detained.
The DHS said that
she was arrested for obstruction.
Yeah.
Are you aware
if she is facing any charges?
I have to, for a second, compartmentalize
the dehumanization
just to get through the question.
You have to forgive me.
Have you heard that she is charges?
I have not heard.
And it would
if she were,
they would be completely baseless,
because the people who violated
laws at that scene where the DHS officers
and in particular,
every officer,
in the way they treated her once
they found out she had a disability,
because Alia was very upfront about it.
She told the officers,
I am a woman with a disability,
I have autism.
She yelled it.
You can hear it on the video.
And they escalated at that point
and then subjected her to a very brutal
use of force,
pulling her out of the car,
slamming her down on the ground,
and then carrying her like an animal.
That's the only way to describe it.
That violates every police standard
and how you are supposed to interact
with somebody in a car,
and it violates every standard.
And how you're supposed to interact
with somebody with a disability."
